Yet, in the end, it was the Wizard's towering pride that proved to be his most grievous flaw, ultimately paving the way for his corruption and subsequent downfall.\n\nSARUMAN THE WHITE\nIntroducing the pinnacle of artisanal craftsmanship: Saruman the White, brought to life in exquisite detail by our master sculptors. Every stroke of the brush, every delicate etching, and every nuanced texture within his robes has been painstakingly crafted to capture the essence of Middle-earth's most notorious wizard. The resplendent intricacies of his flowing beard, the intensity in his piercing gaze, and the powerful aura that surrounds him are all meticulously recreated, making this collectible statue a true testament to the dedication of our artists.\n\nTHE FIRE OF ORTHANC\nA mystical alchemical powder mixed up by the White Wizard. His research and experiments within the Tower of Orthanc brought many new discoveries: what may have once been innocent curiosities, with the Dark Lord's corruption, soon became deadly weapons of war. The powder within this black iron ball held the potential for great destruction, eventually bringing down the mighty wall of Helm's Deep, with an explosive force the likes of which few in Middle-earth could comprehend, let alone rival. \"\n- 1:6 scale;\n- Made from high-quality polystone;\n- Exclusive Fire of Orthanc included, limited to 250 units worldwide;\n- Saruman the White was digitally sculpted by Weta Workshop artist Daniel Holland, and the Fire of Orthanc was sculpted by Shaun Bolton;\n- Saruman the White is presented in his signature pose and clothing, as seen in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy;\n- Created using references to the original props and costume.\n\nDimensions: 20,5 x 33,5 x 20,5 cm","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"model":null,"releaseDate":null,"image":"https://www.merchoid.com/media/catalog/product/cache/ff6cf93a278e35b621122d56a3a1be9e/t/h/the-lord-of-the-rings-saruman-and-the-fire-of-orthanc-classic-series-statue-1-6-33cm-1.jpg","condition":null,"edition":null,"rarity":null,"features":null,"specifications":null,"createdAt":"2025-04-17T09:44:02.305Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-17T09:44:02.320Z","barcode":"9420024743188","deletedAt":null,"source":"heo","hasFakeBarcode":false,"duplicateId":null,"brandId":"91b17e85-6515-4a60-a7bb-549f78164d40","franchiseId":"7388faf4-7dc4-42bc-b00b-720feda7bd85","seriesId":null,"lineId":null,"categories":[{"productId":"3f24044e-7342-40a5-ab08-85be0665d8dd","categoryId":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","category":{"id":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","name":"Collectibles","slug":"collectibles","description":"Collectible items","image":null,"parentId":null,"createdAt":"2025-03-27T23:28:51.587Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:28.529Z","deletedAt":null}}],"retailerPrices":[{"id":"3aeffd3d-73d3-4cb1-a874-64b3db9f9f92","productId":"3f24044e-7342-40a5-ab08-85be0665d8dd","retailerId":"1f7a3891-8fef-4c6c-a126-a2b4ba9e899a","countryId":"2801967a-360d-4f35-b27c-e3d5ca481d8d","price":802.99,"shipping":8.9,"inStock":true,"isPreOrder":false,"url":"https://www.merchoid.com/nl/the-lord-of-the-rings-saruman-and-the-fire-of-orthanc-classic-series-statue-1-6-33cm/","couponCode":null,"lastChecked":"2025-04-17T09:44:02.573Z","createdAt":"2025-04-17T09:44:02.572Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:12.816Z","deletedAt":null,"currency":"EUR","regionId":null,"retailer":{"id":"1f7a3891-8fef-4c6c-a126-a2b4ba9e899a","name":"Merchoid Netherlands","slug":"merchoid-netherlands","logo":null,"website":null,"isActive":true,"createdAt":"2025-03-28T18:07:01.635Z","updatedAt":"2025-03-28T18:07:01.635Z","deletedAt":null,"description":null,"shipping":0,"affiliateCode":null,"affiliateParamKey":null,"useAffiliateCode":false}}],"productMSRPs":[],"brand":{"id":"91b17e85-6515-4a60-a7bb-549f78164d40","name":"Weta Workshop","slug":"weta-workshop","description":"Auto-imported brand: Weta Workshop","createdAt":"2025-03-28T02:41:29.313Z","updatedAt":"2025-03-28T02:41:29.313Z","deletedAt":null},"franchise":{"id":"7388faf4-7dc4-42bc-b00b-720feda7bd85","name":"Lord of the Rings","slug":"lord-of-the-rings","description":"Auto-imported theme: Lord of the Rings","createdAt":"2025-03-27T23:32:17.214Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:31.672Z","deletedAt":null},"series":null,"line":null,"images":[{"url":"https://www.heomedia.com/img/nrm/d_weta860104318.jpg","caption":null,"order":1},{"url":"https://www.merchoid.com/media/catalog/product/cache/ff6cf93a278e35b621122d56a3a1be9e/t/h/the-lord-of-the-rings-saruman-and-the-fire-of-orthanc-classic-series-statue-1-6-33cm-1.jpg","caption":null,"order":2}],"brandName":"Weta Workshop","brandSlug":"weta-workshop","franchiseName":"Lord of the Rings","franchiseSlug":"lord-of-the-rings","seriesName":null,"seriesSlug":null,"lineName":null,"lineSlug":null,"retailerPricesIds":["3aeffd3d-73d3-4cb1-a874-64b3db9f9f92"],"productMSRPsIds":[]}
