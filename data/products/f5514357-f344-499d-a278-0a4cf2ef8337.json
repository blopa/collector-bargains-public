The Odd Beast vs. The Monster!“ from <strong>Naruto Shippuden</strong>. After the Monster of the Hidden Mist, infiltrating the island to locate Naruto and Killer B, emerges from the Waterfall of Truth with valuable information about the ninja alliance, he absorbs Killer B and Aoba's Chakra and escapes, pursued by the Sublime Green Beast of Prey of Konoha! This is the third time their forces clash, it will be the last! Determined to deliver his report at all costs, the Fish-Man hides it in the mouse of a shark and creates a thousand more to breach Guy's Chakra wall, two sharks attacking here at his side, ready to tear him apart.</p>\n<p>Unable to destroy all of these predators, the Power of Youth’s Defender opens the Seventh Gate of Wonder and unleashes his secret weapon and most powerful attack: the Daytime Tiger! Endowed with superhuman strength according to Might Guy, the Cannibal retaliates with a special technique devouring the Chakra of his opponent. We thus see the Akatsuki Shark similar to the ocean’s most frightening predator, with his gills, shark skin, hair in fins, rows of sharp teeth and petrifying gaze of a cold-blooded killer, creating a gigantic Super Shark Bomb Jutsu in bluish transparent resin echoing the depths of the ocean! With outstretched hands, the ruthless <strong>Kisame</strong> hurls his hungry prehistoric monster with innumerable sharp teeth at his prey to make short work of it, this Suiton technique being a more powerful version of the Water Shark Bomb Jutsu. As he explains to his enemy “The Super Shark Bomb Jutsu attack is not a trivial technique. It absorbs all the Chakra it encounters and gains intensity, depending on the power of its opponent's ninjutsu.“ and he will demonstrate it to him.</p>\n<p>As if to attract the feline's attention, a light springs from the shark bowels rising from the abyss of the ocean, crossing the watery Megalodon with its luminous reflection. The shock of the confrontation between the ferocious feline and the bloodthirsty shark unleashes the forces of the ocean, creating a setting of water and foam in transparent resin with different bluish hues around the Shark-Man and his ilk! Mastering all the power of his element, <strong>Itachi Uchiha'</strong>s former partner will stop at nothing to succeed in his mission, whatever its end. On a watery blue edging, Kisame's name appears alongside the crossed-out acronym of the Kiri village which he has deserted. This final message to send reminds us that this solitary predator chooses his own trajectory, and having little fear of troubled waters, will decide for himself the end of his story!</p>\n<p>L : 44 CM D: 47 CM H: 46 CM</p>\n<p><strong>Limited to 1200 Pieces</strong></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"background-image:url(&quot;img/object.gif&quot;);\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WMjjBdT1xtE\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>This product is not a toy or product for children.
