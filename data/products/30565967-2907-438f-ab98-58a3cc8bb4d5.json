With the Marvel HeroClix 400: Cap's Kooky Quartet you'll be ready to play a super-sized game of HeroClix with your friends!\n\nContains:\n\n- 4 HeroClix figures and their character cards\n- Captain America\n- Scarlet Witch\n- Quicksilver\n- Hawkeye\n\nWhat is HeroClix 400?\n\nHeroClix 400 is a product where players will get a full theme team of characters to play right out of the box. They'll recognize these teams from some of their favorite comic book stories. The \"400\" describes the build total - these characters can be used for 400-point games instead of just the usual 300-point games, but they'll be playable as 300-point teams too!\n\nWhy focus on 400-point games?\n\nOur most competitive players have enjoyed 300-point games for a long time. It's been one of the default modes for as long as we can remember.\n\nHowever, over time, we've heard from tournament organizers and casual fans that 400-point games are a lot of fun. They get to play slightly larger squads and slightly higher point-value heroes they love.\n\nTo support these fans, the design team wanted to offer a product that would immediately scale to those bigger games. HeroClix 400 lets players manage a tight team of their faves at 400-points, right out of the box without having to worry over team building. Our suspicion is that after getting in a few games with these super-sized teams, players will find a character or two from their collection that they'd love to try including in their HeroClix 400 team. By using their out-of-the-box team at their 300-point level they'll have the space on their force for those characters!\n\n\n\nContents subject to change\n\nImages not final","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"model":null,"releaseDate":null,"image":"https://www.merchoid.com/media/catalog/product/cache/ff6cf93a278e35b621122d56a3a1be9e/m/a/marvel-cap-s-kooky-quartet-heroclix-400-1.jpg","condition":null,"edition":null,"rarity":null,"features":null,"specifications":null,"createdAt":"2025-04-17T10:28:38.669Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-17T10:28:38.683Z","barcode":"634482850442","deletedAt":null,"source":"heo","hasFakeBarcode":false,"duplicateId":null,"brandId":"ecd2c7e4-ba0b-4326-bcae-c90a3a6f8559","franchiseId":"bf559c2f-32e8-4713-b77b-89d9234ef178","seriesId":null,"lineId":null,"categories":[{"productId":"30565967-2907-438f-ab98-58a3cc8bb4d5","categoryId":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","category":{"id":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","name":"Collectibles","slug":"collectibles","description":"Collectible items","image":null,"parentId":null,"createdAt":"2025-03-27T23:28:51.587Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:28.529Z","deletedAt":null}}],"retailerPrices":[{"id":"03158d01-5006-48c8-b174-1d6703ec82c8","productId":"30565967-2907-438f-ab98-58a3cc8bb4d5","retailerId":"1f7a3891-8fef-4c6c-a126-a2b4ba9e899a","countryId":"2801967a-360d-4f35-b27c-e3d5ca481d8d","price":46.99,"shipping":8.9,"inStock":true,"isPreOrder":false,"url":"https://www.merchoid.com/nl/marvel-cap-s-kooky-quartet-heroclix-400/","couponCode":null,"lastChecked":"2025-04-17T10:28:38.819Z","createdAt":"2025-04-17T10:28:38.819Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:12.816Z","deletedAt":null,"currency":"EUR","regionId":null,"retailer":{"id":"1f7a3891-8fef-4c6c-a126-a2b4ba9e899a","name":"Merchoid Netherlands","slug":"merchoid-netherlands","logo":null,"website":null,"isActive":true,"createdAt":"2025-03-28T18:07:01.635Z","updatedAt":"2025-03-28T18:07:01.635Z","deletedAt":null,"description":null,"shipping":0,"affiliateCode":null,"affiliateParamKey":null,"useAffiliateCode":false}}],"productMSRPs":[],"brand":{"id":"ecd2c7e4-ba0b-4326-bcae-c90a3a6f8559","name":"Wizkids","slug":"wizkids","description":"Auto-imported brand: Wizkids","createdAt":"2025-03-28T02:43:37.517Z","updatedAt":"2025-03-28T02:43:37.517Z","deletedAt":null},"franchise":{"id":"bf559c2f-32e8-4713-b77b-89d9234ef178","name":"Marvel","slug":"marvel","description":"Auto-imported theme: Marvel","createdAt":"2025-03-27T23:31:34.643Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:31.483Z","deletedAt":null},"series":null,"line":null,"images":[{"url":"https://www.heomedia.com/img/nrm/d_wiz85044.jpg","caption":null,"order":1},{"url":"https://www.merchoid.com/media/catalog/product/cache/ff6cf93a278e35b621122d56a3a1be9e/m/a/marvel-cap-s-kooky-quartet-heroclix-400-1.jpg","caption":null,"order":2}],"brandName":"Wizkids","brandSlug":"wizkids","franchiseName":"Marvel","franchiseSlug":"marvel","seriesName":null,"seriesSlug":null,"lineName":null,"lineSlug":null,"retailerPricesIds":["03158d01-5006-48c8-b174-1d6703ec82c8"],"productMSRPsIds":[]}
