Her powers are controlled by her emotions and, because of that, it's essential that she maintains her serenity. Iron Studios present the statue \"Storm - X-Men' 97 - Art Scale\n1/10\", presenting innovation in the painting in the form of a specific shading that highlights all the figures from this new collection as if the characters were coming out of the TV to the real world, Iron Studios present the statues from their new X-Men '97 line, over a themed base shaped as the \"X\" of the logo of the super group\nof mutant heroes.\n\nIn a small village next to Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa, Ororo Munroe was born a mutant with the ability to control and manipulate the forces of nature with a wide range of weathers, such as making whirlwinds travel pointing lengthwise in any direction, flash-freezing objects and people, summoning wind currents strong\nenough to support her weight to elevate herself (or others) and fly. She developed her powers early on and used them to help her village. As a child, Ororo was nearly buried alive, and that caused her to develop claustrophobia, that still afflicts her today. She faced the villain called Shadow King, whom Professor Charles Xavier had to saver her from. Ororo then joined the Xavier's X-Men and took on the codename of Storm. She then became the third in command of the group, after Xavier and Cyclops. Always searching for the best path in any situation, she is usually witty with her X-Men teammates and seems to have a good sense of humor.\n\nReleased on March 2024, X-Men '97 is a new animated series that is a sequel to the 1992 show \"X-Men: The Animated Series\", continuing the plot from where the original series ended. After the loss of their leader Professor X, Storm and Wolverine try to continue the X-Men. Magneto arrives and wishes to replace Charles Xavier and Mr. Sinister returns to try to end the X-Men once and for all. Produced by Marvel Studios Animation for streaming service Disney+, the show's animation was updated in relation to the original series to use a more sophisticated and modern technology, presenting modernized designs. The theme song is similar to the one from the original show, but was credited to Haim Saban and Shuki Levy, musical producers from X-Men: The Animated Series. X-Men '97 will be the first project en\u0002tirely produced by Marvel Studios that is not part of the MCU. The series is also the first X-Men project by Marvel Studios since they got back the movie and TV rights for the characters, and Eric Lewald described the show as an extension of the original series created by the Marvel Studios team. Already available for Pre-Order worldwide, perfectly simulating the looks from the new animated cartoon X-Men '97, Iron Studios present this new collection that promises to conquer the hearts\nboth of collectors and veteran fans from the 90s, and fans from past and recent generations that were captivated by the first series and are looking forward for its sequel.
