{"id":"0c72c0cd-0fbe-43c9-8ce1-165df8563a97","name":"The Hobbit Trilogy Statue 18 Gardens Smial 15 cm","slug":"the-hobbit-trilogy-statue-18-gardens-smi","description":"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole. It was a Hobbit Hole, and that means comfort.\n\nBright round doors in summery hues dot the lush, grassy hillsides of Hobbiton like wildflowers. Behind each doorway, comfortably appointed burrows wind into earth: each one home to a Hobbit, or a family of the Shire's rosy-cheeked little-folk.\n\nEvery Hobbit Hole is unique, expressing the personality of its inhabitants with colour, prettily adorned gardens, furniture, and the rustic debris of everyday life. An unpainted front door sets this home apart from the rest, but it is no less cosy. Capitalizing on the natural earthen tone of the front door, a warm autumnal hue peppers the surrounding trees and ivy, creating a subtle yet inviting abode.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Easy to display - just 6 inch wide;\n- An exact replica of the real Hobbit Hole at the Hobbiton movie set;\n- Complete your Shire and collect the entire range.\n\nDimensions: 15,5 x 7 x 6 cm","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"model":null,"releaseDate":null,"image":"https://www.merchoid.com/media/catalog/product/cache/ff6cf93a278e35b621122d56a3a1be9e/t/h/the-hobbit-trilogy-gardens-of-the-smial-statue-18-15cm-1.jpg","condition":null,"edition":null,"rarity":null,"features":null,"specifications":null,"createdAt":"2025-04-17T09:43:44.663Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-17T09:43:44.680Z","barcode":"9420024741535","deletedAt":null,"source":"heo","hasFakeBarcode":false,"duplicateId":null,"brandId":"91b17e85-6515-4a60-a7bb-549f78164d40","franchiseId":"74205373-e6a1-4dbb-8e7b-32430fc21ec6","seriesId":null,"lineId":null,"categories":[{"productId":"0c72c0cd-0fbe-43c9-8ce1-165df8563a97","categoryId":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","category":{"id":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","name":"Collectibles","slug":"collectibles","description":"Collectible items","image":null,"parentId":null,"createdAt":"2025-03-27T23:28:51.587Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:28.529Z","deletedAt":null}}],"retailerPrices":[{"id":"e1662a4f-78ac-447a-ba4d-ec26282507c3","productId":"0c72c0cd-0fbe-43c9-8ce1-165df8563a97","retailerId":"1f7a3891-8fef-4c6c-a126-a2b4ba9e899a","countryId":"2801967a-360d-4f35-b27c-e3d5ca481d8d","price":206.99,"shipping":8.9,"inStock":true,"isPreOrder":false,"url":"https://www.merchoid.com/nl/the-hobbit-trilogy-gardens-of-the-smial-statue-18-15cm/","couponCode":null,"lastChecked":"2025-04-17T09:43:44.913Z","createdAt":"2025-04-17T09:43:44.912Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:12.816Z","deletedAt":null,"currency":"EUR","regionId":null,"retailer":{"id":"1f7a3891-8fef-4c6c-a126-a2b4ba9e899a","name":"Merchoid Netherlands","slug":"merchoid-netherlands","logo":null,"website":null,"isActive":true,"createdAt":"2025-03-28T18:07:01.635Z","updatedAt":"2025-03-28T18:07:01.635Z","deletedAt":null,"description":null,"shipping":0,"affiliateCode":null,"affiliateParamKey":null,"useAffiliateCode":false}}],"productMSRPs":[],"brand":{"id":"91b17e85-6515-4a60-a7bb-549f78164d40","name":"Weta Workshop","slug":"weta-workshop","description":"Auto-imported brand: Weta Workshop","createdAt":"2025-03-28T02:41:29.313Z","updatedAt":"2025-03-28T02:41:29.313Z","deletedAt":null},"franchise":{"id":"74205373-e6a1-4dbb-8e7b-32430fc21ec6","name":"The Hobbit","slug":"the-hobbit","description":"Auto-imported theme: The Hobbit","createdAt":"2025-03-28T01:12:46.183Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:37.894Z","deletedAt":null},"series":null,"line":null,"images":[{"url":"https://www.heomedia.com/img/nrm/d_weta871004153.jpg","caption":null,"order":1},{"url":"https://www.merchoid.com/media/catalog/product/cache/ff6cf93a278e35b621122d56a3a1be9e/t/h/the-hobbit-trilogy-gardens-of-the-smial-statue-18-15cm-1.jpg","caption":null,"order":2}],"brandName":"Weta Workshop","brandSlug":"weta-workshop","franchiseName":"The Hobbit","franchiseSlug":"the-hobbit","seriesName":null,"seriesSlug":null,"lineName":null,"lineSlug":null,"retailerPricesIds":["e1662a4f-78ac-447a-ba4d-ec26282507c3"],"productMSRPsIds":[]}
