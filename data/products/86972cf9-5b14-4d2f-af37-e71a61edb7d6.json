As Clark grew up, the radiation from Earth's yellow sun gave him extraordinary powers, which he kept hidden. Now fully grown, he uses his powers to protect his adopted world as Superman. The Man of Steel is virtually invulnerable and has the powers of super-strength, super-speed, and flight. He also has enhanced senses, including heat vision, X-ray vision, super-hearing, and super-breath.\n\n\nChase version possible.","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"model":null,"releaseDate":null,"image":"https://www.pixelatoy.com/227120-large_default/superman-return-of-superman-dc-multiverse.jpg","condition":null,"edition":null,"rarity":null,"features":null,"specifications":null,"createdAt":"2025-04-17T14:37:04.597Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-17T14:37:04.633Z","barcode":"787926171297","deletedAt":null,"source":"heo","hasFakeBarcode":false,"duplicateId":null,"brandId":"bb72660b-08cf-4e73-bdd9-6624e914816d","franchiseId":"f80b556d-2aaf-4ca7-ac59-875ead89ec0d","seriesId":null,"lineId":null,"categories":[{"productId":"86972cf9-5b14-4d2f-af37-e71a61edb7d6","categoryId":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","category":{"id":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","name":"Collectibles","slug":"collectibles","description":"Collectible items","image":null,"parentId":null,"createdAt":"2025-03-27T23:28:51.587Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:28.529Z","deletedAt":null}}],"retailerPrices":[{"id":"cb66187f-f454-412e-a634-5dc0c21d7ce5","productId":"86972cf9-5b14-4d2f-af37-e71a61edb7d6","retailerId":"2d383e94-31d6-4cea-9869-6836d242641a","countryId":"1e31ca7e-16ed-416a-a2f3-7bdbe780e059","price":34.9,"shipping":8.9,"inStock":true,"isPreOrder":false,"url":"https://www.pixelatoy.com/es/reservas/26693-superman-return-of-superman-dc-multiverse-787926171297.html","couponCode":null,"lastChecked":"2025-04-17T14:37:04.801Z","createdAt":"2025-04-17T14:37:04.800Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:12.889Z","deletedAt":null,"currency":"EUR","regionId":null,"retailer":{"id":"2d383e94-31d6-4cea-9869-6836d242641a","name":"Pixelatoy","slug":"pixelatoy","logo":null,"website":null,"isActive":true,"createdAt":"2025-03-29T20:38:16.733Z","updatedAt":"2025-03-29T20:38:16.733Z","deletedAt":null,"description":null,"shipping":0,"affiliateCode":null,"affiliateParamKey":null,"useAffiliateCode":false}}],"productMSRPs":[],"brand":{"id":"bb72660b-08cf-4e73-bdd9-6624e914816d","name":"McFarlane Toys","slug":"mcfarlane-toys","description":"Auto-imported brand: McFarlane Toys","createdAt":"2025-03-28T01:17:37.518Z","updatedAt":"2025-03-28T01:17:37.518Z","deletedAt":null},"franchise":{"id":"f80b556d-2aaf-4ca7-ac59-875ead89ec0d","name":"DC Comics","slug":"dc-comics","description":"Auto-imported theme: DC Comics","createdAt":"2025-03-27T23:35:29.561Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:32.305Z","deletedAt":null},"series":null,"line":null,"images":[{"url":"https://www.heomedia.com/img/nrm/d_mcf17129.jpg","caption":null,"order":1},{"url":"https://www.pixelatoy.com/227120-large_default/superman-return-of-superman-dc-multiverse.jpg","caption":null,"order":2}],"brandName":"McFarlane Toys","brandSlug":"mcfarlane-toys","franchiseName":"DC Comics","franchiseSlug":"dc-comics","seriesName":null,"seriesSlug":null,"lineName":null,"lineSlug":null,"retailerPricesIds":["cb66187f-f454-412e-a634-5dc0c21d7ce5"],"productMSRPsIds":[]}
