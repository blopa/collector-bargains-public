{"id":"7d4c12e2-6d33-4cfd-8087-094917794e98","name":"Saint Seiya Deluxe Art Scale Statue 1/10 Andromeda Shun 23 cm","slug":"saint-seiya-deluxe-art-scale-statue-110h","description":"Iron Studios bring the Andromeda Cloth in a new exclusive statue!\n\nWith the trigonal end of his powerful chain ready for a quick and objective attack, always facing the direction where the enemy is and following the commands of his right hand, and the other round end of the chain held by his left hand in front of his body, ready to defend him, the young Saint with green eyes and hair, presents himself with his pink Cloth over an also green costume, reluctant but ready for battle, burning his cosmos with the image of his guardian constellation in the shape of the goddess Andromeda (with LED lights) by his side, the goddess that was chained to a rock to soothe the rage of Poseidon, the God of the Sea. Over a base of the cold stone steps of the Sanctuary, Iron Studios proudly present their statue \"Andromeda Shun Deluxe - Saint Seiya - Art Scale 1/10\", with the youngest of the main bronze Saints defenders of Athena, in his first statue produced by Iron Studios.\n\nIron Studios also bring the statue in the regular version \"Andromeda Shun - Saint Seiya - Art Scale 1/10\", without the figure of goddess Andromeda next to the young Bronze Saint, over the base of the stone steps of the Sanctuary.\n\nShun is the younger brother of Bronze Saint Phoenix Ikki and was sent to Andromeda Island to become a Saint with the mission of protecting the Goddess Athena. Gifted with noble nature and a pacifist, he represses his huge power and prefers to offer himself in sacrifice for peace instead of fighting. Owner of the purest heart on Earth in his time, his master was the Silver Saint Cepheus Albiore, that taught Shun how to conciliate strength and tenderness within his cosmos. As the training's result, six years later, Shun survived the Sacrifice of Andromeda, challenge in which he was chained to two rocks in the sea and had to scape before the tide rose completely and drowned him. His armor from the constellation of Andromeda is one of the most powerful in the Bronze category. Not because it is more resistant than the others, but because it is equipped with a powerful weapon: Andromeda's chains. They are a pair of chains considered to be the perfect balance between attack and defense. That is exactly why they display great versatility in combat and are used in most of Shun's special techniques. Shun only allows himself to fight in case of extreme need, or when his near infinite patience runs dry. In those cases, he can become an extremely skillful and deadly fighter.\n\nOriginally created for manga by Masami Kurumada in 1986 and adapted for anime by Toei Animation between 1986 and 1989, the show Saint Seiya brings the story of five mystic Bronze Saints that fight to defend the human incarnation of the Goddess Athena, wearing sacred Cloths, based on many constellations.
