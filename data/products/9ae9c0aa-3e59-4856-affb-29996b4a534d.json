Stoic and strong, they are used for everything from agricultural labor to war, foraging lazily in paddocks or carrying Twi'lek guerrillas and clone troopers into battle. Although they appear harmless and docile, their toothy mouths can betray a fierce demeanor; females are known to devour the males of the species during mating season.\n\nContinuing to expand the highly popular, The Mandalorian collectible series, Sideshow and Hot Toys is delighted to introduce the Blurrg Sixth Scale Figure as seen on the planet of Arvala-7.\n\nThe highly accurate Blurrg is skillfully developed based on the appearance of the creature in The Mandalorian.
