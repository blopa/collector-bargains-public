He is the fusion of the Dinoforce, a team of six Decepticon Pretenders, each transforming into a mechanical dinosaur. The members – Goryu, Kakuryu, Doryu, Rairyu, Yokuryu, and Gairyu – wear biologically inspired armor to disguise their true robot forms.Dinoking is often considered the Japanese counterpart of Monstructor from the Western continuity, although his colors and background differ. In the Legacy United line, Dinoking receives a modern reissue, retooled from the Core Class Volcanicus combiner, finally allowing fans to obtain a contemporary version of this rare and beloved figure.They are often portrayed as less serious and somewhat comedic counterparts to the Dinobots, with a tendency for clumsiness. Despite the set’s name, Dinoking is NOT a Dinobot.","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"model":null,"releaseDate":null,"image":"https://cdn.myonlinestore.eu/941eb4b5-6be1-11e9-a722-44a8421b9960/image/cache/article/064bcfadfce89c8a0720af07a388c0de3f39d5a8.jpg","condition":null,"edition":null,"rarity":null,"features":null,"specifications":null,"createdAt":"2025-04-17T15:03:14.914Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-17T15:03:14.914Z","barcode":"5010996263322","deletedAt":null,"source":"heo","hasFakeBarcode":false,"duplicateId":null,"brandId":"f2f38d15-d011-4da9-a162-7e97d9e06904","franchiseId":null,"seriesId":null,"lineId":null,"categories":[{"productId":"f1749cb9-9525-4945-8cee-4104422fe234","categoryId":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","category":{"id":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","name":"Collectibles","slug":"collectibles","description":"Collectible items","image":null,"parentId":null,"createdAt":"2025-03-27T23:28:51.587Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:28.529Z","deletedAt":null}}],"retailerPrices":[{"id":"6e581ca4-8be4-423b-af4d-fd0a84a782f5","productId":"f1749cb9-9525-4945-8cee-4104422fe234","retailerId":"8f11ac17-d4b3-4834-b25d-e43e45466192","countryId":"2801967a-360d-4f35-b27c-e3d5ca481d8d","price":109.99,"shipping":8.9,"inStock":true,"isPreOrder":false,"url":"https://www.tf-robots.nl/en_GB/a-95960432/transformers-legacy/g0181-transformers-legacy-united-dinobot-dinoking-multipack/","couponCode":null,"lastChecked":"2025-04-17T15:03:15.454Z","createdAt":"2025-04-17T15:03:15.453Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:12.934Z","deletedAt":null,"currency":"EUR","regionId":null,"retailer":{"id":"8f11ac17-d4b3-4834-b25d-e43e45466192","name":"TF Robots","slug":"tf-robots","logo":null,"website":null,"isActive":true,"createdAt":"2025-03-29T21:32:49.149Z","updatedAt":"2025-03-29T21:32:49.149Z","deletedAt":null,"description":null,"shipping":0,"affiliateCode":null,"affiliateParamKey":null,"useAffiliateCode":false}}],"productMSRPs":[],"brand":{"id":"f2f38d15-d011-4da9-a162-7e97d9e06904","name":"Hasbro","slug":"hasbro","description":"Auto-imported brand: Hasbro","createdAt":"2025-03-28T00:38:44.616Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-18T17:30:14.585Z","deletedAt":null},"franchise":null,"series":null,"line":null,"images":[{"url":"https://cdn.myonlinestore.eu/941eb4b5-6be1-11e9-a722-44a8421b9960/image/cache/article/064bcfadfce89c8a0720af07a388c0de3f39d5a8.jpg","caption":null,"order":1}],"brandName":"Hasbro","brandSlug":"hasbro","franchiseName":null,"franchiseSlug":null,"seriesName":null,"seriesSlug":null,"lineName":null,"lineSlug":null,"retailerPricesIds":["6e581ca4-8be4-423b-af4d-fd0a84a782f5"],"productMSRPsIds":[]}
