The Odd Beast vs. The Monster! ».</p>\n<p>As the Konoha’s jōnin rank ninja arrives at the Water Fall of Truth to aid <strong>Naruto</strong> in his training, he comes face to face with the Monster of the Hidden Mist that infiltrated the island to locate Naruto and Killer B! This is the third time their forces clash, it must be the last! He certainly won’t let <strong>Itachi Uchiha</strong>’s former partner run away with the information gathered about the ninja alliance! As the shark-like Swordsman of the Mist attacks him with his terrifying Super Shark Bomb Jutsu absorbing ninjutsu attacks, the Taijutsu master brings out his secret weapon! With his red Konoha forehead band belted at the waist, orange leggings, black hair and green protective vest thrown into the air, the Power of Youth’s defender is seen in an attack position, retaliating with his most powerful technique: the Daytime Tiger! This technique of taijutsu, Hirudora, requires the opening of seven of the Eight Gates. Thus, after opening the seventh Gate, that of Wonder, the team leader places the palm of his extended hand in front of him and hits it with his other closed hand, suddenly increasing the pressure of the air in front of him. We then see the Konoha’s Sublime Green Beast of Prey, his red eyes glowing with rage with his bright green chakra flames, forming the incantatory sign specific to his technique: the index and middle fingers crossed and the other fingers outstretched. The resulting mass of compressed air is then projected in the direction of Kisame taking on the appearance of a huge ghostly rabid tiger, sculpted here in white transparent resin with varying degrees of opacity. Roaring, it swoops down on its prey wildly, its gigantic illuminated jaws ready to make short work of Kisame. On contact with the target, the suddenly decompressed air causes a gigantic explosion, causing visible shock waves agitating the raging waters in bluish transparent resin, highlighting the power of the unstoppable attack and location of this epic last stand! The symbol of the victorious ninja of Konoha proudly appears on the front of the statue’s base... Who’s next?!</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>Features:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>W: 41 Cm X D: 52 Cm X H: 44 Cm</li>\n<li>Resin Pvc Magnets Leds</li>\n<li>T4 2023 - T2 2024</li>\n<li>1800 Pieces</li>\n</ul>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"background-image:url(&quot;img/object.gif&quot;);\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CvLMyEIq-uM\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>This product is not a toy or product for children.
