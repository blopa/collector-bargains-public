Dragon... Cannon... Ha ha ha!\"\n\n\"KAMEN RIDER RYUGEN BUDOU ARMS\" joins the Shinkocchou Seihou series with a brand-new format featuring the Arms Change system! This figure is fully compatible for swapping armor and equipment with the existing S.H.Figuarts (Shinkocchou Seihou) Kamen Rider Gaim series.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEvery detail of the Arms (armor) has been meticulously crafted, down to the intricate folds of the waist drape. The metallic green finish on both the Arms (armor) and the under-suit \"Rider Wear\" perfectly captures the look and feel of the drama.\nThe \"Bukenkou\" shoulder armor features two points of articulation, allowing for outward movement, while the waist drape is made with soft material to preserve articulation. You can enjoy posing Ryugen in different action poses.\n\nThis set includes the \"Budou Ryuhou\" (Grape Dragon Cannon), a handgun-style Arms Weapon, which can be held using dedicated hand parts for added expressiveness. Also included are newly sculpted hand parts exclusive to Ryugen, allowing for even more intense posing. The Budou Ryuhou is equipped with a sliding rear lever, the \"Ryokuhou Gekitetsu,\" and comes with a special hand part designed to grip the lever—perfect for recreating bullet reload and special attacks!\n\nFor even more customization, a hand part for operating the Cutting Blade of \"Sengoku Driver\" is also included. The \"Budou Lockseed\" comes in two versions—standard and panel-opened—offering interchangeable display options.\nThe general-purpose hands included allow Ryugen to wield weapons from other S.H.Figuarts (Shinkocchou Seihou) Kamen Rider Gaim figures. You can equip the \"Daidaimaru\" from the \"S.H.Figuarts (Shinkocchou Seihou) Kamen Rider Gaim Orange Arms\" (sold separately) to recreate the unforgettable final battle!\n\nTake customization even further by swapping in armor from the \"S.H.Figuarts (Shinkocchou Seihou) Kamen Rider Gaim Orange Arms\" (sold separately) or \"S.H.Figuarts (Shinkocchou Seihou) Kamen Rider Baron Banana Arms\" (sold separately) to create \"Kamen Rider Ryugen Orange Arms\" and \"Kamen Rider Ryugen Banana Arms\"—forms never seen in the drama! Likewise, the Budou Arms can be equipped onto Gaim or Baron, offering even more possibilities.\n\nFor ultimate authenticity, specialized compound eye parts are included, ensuring accurate proportions even for Arms Change forms like \"Kamen Rider Baron Banana Arms,\" where the distance between the compound eyes and head armor differs.\n\nWith more Armored Riders joining the Shinkocchou Seihou lineup, the Rider Sengoku Era enters a new stage!","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"model":null,"releaseDate":null,"image":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785557001001_010.jpg","condition":null,"edition":null,"rarity":null,"features":null,"specifications":null,"createdAt":"2025-04-03T23:40:50.741Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-15T15:37:28.107Z","barcode":"1e28c55c-4f85-4b8e-a68c-bfac7e73ff1a","deletedAt":null,"source":"scraped","hasFakeBarcode":true,"duplicateId":null,"brandId":"9666dbf2-4fd0-4a71-93f5-559c909f5890","franchiseId":null,"seriesId":null,"lineId":null,"categories":[{"productId":"e4e08105-d306-4b45-bd22-559c050f7771","categoryId":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","category":{"id":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","name":"Collectibles","slug":"collectibles","description":"Collectible items","image":null,"parentId":null,"createdAt":"2025-03-27T23:28:51.587Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:28.529Z","deletedAt":null}}],"retailerPrices":[{"id":"93187336-7a20-4fea-916d-a9f0104f90ae","productId":"e4e08105-d306-4b45-bd22-559c050f7771","retailerId":"8e967743-b1d4-446e-bd1d-25379fdc7dc6","countryId":"cfa253f4-b9e1-4488-9eba-3ea3f0834e01","price":100,"shipping":9.99,"inStock":true,"isPreOrder":true,"url":"https://p-bandai.com/us/item/N2785557001001","couponCode":null,"lastChecked":"2025-04-03T23:40:55.675Z","createdAt":"2025-04-03T23:40:55.674Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:13.103Z","deletedAt":null,"currency":"USD","regionId":null,"retailer":{"id":"8e967743-b1d4-446e-bd1d-25379fdc7dc6","name":"Premium Bandai","slug":"premium-bandai","logo":null,"website":null,"isActive":true,"createdAt":"2025-04-03T23:40:34.094Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-03T23:40:34.094Z","deletedAt":null,"description":null,"shipping":0,"affiliateCode":null,"affiliateParamKey":null,"useAffiliateCode":false}}],"productMSRPs":[],"brand":{"id":"9666dbf2-4fd0-4a71-93f5-559c909f5890","name":"S.H.Figuarts (SHINKOCCHOU SEIHOU)","slug":"shfiguarts-shinkocchou-seihou","description":"S.H.Figuarts (SHINKOCCHOU SEIHOU)","createdAt":"2025-04-03T23:40:42.034Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-15T15:38:41.236Z","deletedAt":null},"franchise":null,"series":null,"line":null,"images":[{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785557001001_001.jpg","caption":null,"order":1},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785557001001_002.jpg","caption":null,"order":2},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785557001001_003.jpg","caption":null,"order":3},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785557001001_004.jpg","caption":null,"order":4},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785557001001_005.jpg","caption":null,"order":5},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785557001001_006.jpg","caption":null,"order":6},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785557001001_007.jpg","caption":null,"order":7},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785557001001_008.jpg","caption":null,"order":8},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785557001001_009.jpg","caption":null,"order":9},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785557001001_010.jpg","caption":null,"order":10}],"brandName":"S.H.Figuarts (SHINKOCCHOU SEIHOU)","brandSlug":"shfiguarts-shinkocchou-seihou","franchiseName":null,"franchiseSlug":null,"seriesName":null,"seriesSlug":null,"lineName":null,"lineSlug":null,"retailerPricesIds":["93187336-7a20-4fea-916d-a9f0104f90ae"],"productMSRPsIds":[]}
