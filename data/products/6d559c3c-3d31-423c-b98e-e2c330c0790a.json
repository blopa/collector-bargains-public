Chiho Kiyooka (YU YU HAKUSHO), Takeshi Ike (TRANSFORMERS) and Keiju Ishikawa (GODZILLA) collaborated on the anime series' iconic music.</p>","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"model":null,"releaseDate":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/lcdn-products/4/2/4/6/2/6/424626-large_default.webp","condition":null,"edition":null,"rarity":null,"features":null,"specifications":null,"createdAt":"2025-04-06T10:46:49.561Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-18T16:47:55.093Z","barcode":"3701627800420","deletedAt":null,"source":"heo","hasFakeBarcode":false,"duplicateId":null,"brandId":"5d8b9af8-5ef2-4b4f-a69f-3305a6ed3c9e","franchiseId":null,"seriesId":null,"lineId":null,"categories":[{"productId":"6d559c3c-3d31-423c-b98e-e2c330c0790a","categoryId":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","category":{"id":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","name":"Collectibles","slug":"collectibles","description":"Collectible items","image":null,"parentId":null,"createdAt":"2025-03-27T23:28:51.587Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:28.529Z","deletedAt":null}}],"retailerPrices":[{"id":"a4e18b64-884c-47ae-ad82-458c8c1dc665","productId":"6d559c3c-3d31-423c-b98e-e2c330c0790a","retailerId":"3bb9428e-22e9-48ef-8591-ac4f383ac247","countryId":"37640b00-904f-4b4d-a385-bc7f8275eb25","price":49.99,"shipping":8.9,"inStock":true,"isPreOrder":true,"url":"https://www.lacitedesnuages.be/en/49180-dragon-ball-z-vinyl-soundtrack-best-collection-limited-edition-2x.html","couponCode":null,"lastChecked":"2025-04-06T10:46:49.819Z","createdAt":"2025-04-06T10:46:49.819Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:12.789Z","deletedAt":null,"currency":"EUR","regionId":null,"retailer":{"id":"3bb9428e-22e9-48ef-8591-ac4f383ac247","name":"La Cité des Nuages","slug":"la-cite-des-nuages","logo":null,"website":null,"isActive":true,"createdAt":"2025-03-28T17:28:51.870Z","updatedAt":"2025-03-28T17:28:51.870Z","deletedAt":null,"description":null,"shipping":0,"affiliateCode":null,"affiliateParamKey":null,"useAffiliateCode":false}}],"productMSRPs":[],"brand":{"id":"5d8b9af8-5ef2-4b4f-a69f-3305a6ed3c9e","name":"Microids Records","slug":"microids-records","description":null,"createdAt":"2025-04-18T16:47:55.074Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-18T17:18:20.393Z","deletedAt":null},"franchise":null,"series":null,"line":null,"images":[{"url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/lcdn-products/4/2/4/6/2/7/424627-large_default.webp","caption":null,"order":1},{"url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/lcdn-products/4/2/4/6/2/5/424625-large_default.webp","caption":null,"order":2},{"url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/lcdn-products/4/2/4/6/2/8/424628-large_default.webp","caption":null,"order":3},{"url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/lcdn-products/4/2/4/6/2/6/424626-large_default.webp","caption":null,"order":4}],"brandName":"Microids Records","brandSlug":"microids-records","franchiseName":null,"franchiseSlug":null,"seriesName":null,"seriesSlug":null,"lineName":null,"lineSlug":null,"retailerPricesIds":["a4e18b64-884c-47ae-ad82-458c8c1dc665"],"productMSRPsIds":[]}
