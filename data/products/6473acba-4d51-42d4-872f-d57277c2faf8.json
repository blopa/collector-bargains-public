Ruling over the hellish world of Apokolips, Darkseid doesn't merely mean to conquer a planet or subjugate his enemies-he seeks to rob the entire universe of its free will and replace it with his own. To this end, Darkseid employs the vast power of the Anti-Life Equation, a mysterious formula that would allow him to remove all free will from every sentient life-form in the known universe. In his quest for ultimate power, the immortal Darkseid has repeatedly come into conflict with Apokolips' sister world, the heavenly New Genesis, along with heroes like Superman and the Justice League.\n\nKey Features:\n\n- Continuing the legacy of the DC Super Powers line of the 80s, comes a brand new batch of your favorite heroes and villains in the classic nostalgia series we all love\n- Classic 4\" scale Super Powers Figures with 5 points of Articulation\n- Darkseid is featured in his New 52 look\n- Comes packaged in iconic Super Powers blister card packaging with updated artwork and logos reflecting your favorite characters","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"model":null,"releaseDate":null,"image":"https://cdn.myonlinestore.eu/941eb4b5-6be1-11e9-a722-44a8421b9960/image/cache/article/ef20f7e7d7cca4918f0fb52c8c9c57c60b4fd5f2.jpg","condition":null,"edition":null,"rarity":null,"features":null,"specifications":null,"createdAt":"2025-04-17T15:15:55.589Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-17T15:15:55.609Z","barcode":"787926157697","deletedAt":null,"source":"heo","hasFakeBarcode":false,"duplicateId":null,"brandId":"bb72660b-08cf-4e73-bdd9-6624e914816d","franchiseId":"f80b556d-2aaf-4ca7-ac59-875ead89ec0d","seriesId":null,"lineId":null,"categories":[{"productId":"6473acba-4d51-42d4-872f-d57277c2faf8","categoryId":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","category":{"id":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","name":"Collectibles","slug":"collectibles","description":"Collectible items","image":null,"parentId":null,"createdAt":"2025-03-27T23:28:51.587Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:28.529Z","deletedAt":null}}],"retailerPrices":[{"id":"efcc0f64-f09f-41ce-8d5b-290a86258763","productId":"6473acba-4d51-42d4-872f-d57277c2faf8","retailerId":"8f11ac17-d4b3-4834-b25d-e43e45466192","countryId":"2801967a-360d-4f35-b27c-e3d5ca481d8d","price":14.99,"shipping":8.9,"inStock":true,"isPreOrder":false,"url":"https://www.tf-robots.nl/en_GB/a-75553689/dc-multiverse/mcf15769-dc-direct-super-powers-new-52-darkseid/","couponCode":null,"lastChecked":"2025-04-17T15:15:55.866Z","createdAt":"2025-04-17T15:15:55.865Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:12.934Z","deletedAt":null,"currency":"EUR","regionId":null,"retailer":{"id":"8f11ac17-d4b3-4834-b25d-e43e45466192","name":"TF Robots","slug":"tf-robots","logo":null,"website":null,"isActive":true,"createdAt":"2025-03-29T21:32:49.149Z","updatedAt":"2025-03-29T21:32:49.149Z","deletedAt":null,"description":null,"shipping":0,"affiliateCode":null,"affiliateParamKey":null,"useAffiliateCode":false}}],"productMSRPs":[],"brand":{"id":"bb72660b-08cf-4e73-bdd9-6624e914816d","name":"McFarlane Toys","slug":"mcfarlane-toys","description":"Auto-imported brand: McFarlane Toys","createdAt":"2025-03-28T01:17:37.518Z","updatedAt":"2025-03-28T01:17:37.518Z","deletedAt":null},"franchise":{"id":"f80b556d-2aaf-4ca7-ac59-875ead89ec0d","name":"DC Comics","slug":"dc-comics","description":"Auto-imported theme: DC Comics","createdAt":"2025-03-27T23:35:29.561Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:32.305Z","deletedAt":null},"series":null,"line":null,"images":[{"url":"https://www.heomedia.com/img/nrm/d_mcf15769.jpg","caption":null,"order":1},{"url":"https://cdn.myonlinestore.eu/941eb4b5-6be1-11e9-a722-44a8421b9960/image/cache/article/ef20f7e7d7cca4918f0fb52c8c9c57c60b4fd5f2.jpg","caption":null,"order":2}],"brandName":"McFarlane Toys","brandSlug":"mcfarlane-toys","franchiseName":"DC Comics","franchiseSlug":"dc-comics","seriesName":null,"seriesSlug":null,"lineName":null,"lineSlug":null,"retailerPricesIds":["efcc0f64-f09f-41ce-8d5b-290a86258763"],"productMSRPsIds":[]}
