Model Color is indicated for all surfaces, and especially formulated to adhere to plastics and polyesters.<br /><br />The Modelcolor range contains 208 colors and an extensive assortment of mediums and varnishes, designed especially for Miniature and Modelpainting. The colors have been chosen with the help and advice of the best model painters from many countries. Those colors which have corresponding Federal Standard, Ral and RLM equivalencies are so identified.<br /><br />Modelcolor has been formulated with permanent pigments for fine arts; all colors are completely lightfast and opaque, (with the exception of the fluorescent and transparent colors, which are semi-opaque). A few metallic pigments (in an alcohol base) are included in the range, since these give a harder brilliance than the waterbased metallics.<br /><br />The consistency of Modelcolor allows for an extremely smooth and uniform paintfilm, with no trace of brushstrokes. Professional model painters always work with a wet brush and dilute the paint with water or Mat Medium, applying many thin layers to achieve depth and shadows. Colors may also be diluted with other Mediums for glazes and layered applications.<br /><br />The waterbased formula of Modelcolor has been specifically developed for adherence on difficult surfaces such as metal and plastic, but the product is not toxic, not flammable, and does not give off noxious fumes. Errors can be corrected immediately with water or alcohol Modelcolor dries quickly to a matte, even and waterproof finish. Exact drying time depends on the temperature and humidity of the environment, on the surface which has been painted, and on the thickness of the paint layer - although the colors are dry to the touch within minutes, the water content keeps on evaporating, and the paint does not acquire its true permanence until several weeks after application.<br /><br />Modelcolor is presented in plastic bottles of 17ml. with an eyedropper device which keeps paint from drying and prevents spills.<br /><br />8 Metallic colors in alcohol based are presented in childproof bottles of 35 ml.<br /><br />This product is not a toy or product for children. It is a collectors item intended for adults only.</p>","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"model":null,"releaseDate":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/lcdn-products/5/2/6/6/7/52667-large_default.webp","condition":null,"edition":null,"rarity":null,"features":null,"specifications":null,"createdAt":"2025-04-06T11:16:48.370Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-18T17:00:15.133Z","barcode":"8429551701723","deletedAt":null,"source":"heo","hasFakeBarcode":false,"duplicateId":null,"brandId":"21ae7000-6836-4501-a6c6-4490a0eb7e37","franchiseId":null,"seriesId":null,"lineId":null,"categories":[{"productId":"686055e9-b1ca-4efc-b60c-e0fa49208cb3","categoryId":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","category":{"id":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","name":"Collectibles","slug":"collectibles","description":"Collectible items","image":null,"parentId":null,"createdAt":"2025-03-27T23:28:51.587Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:28.529Z","deletedAt":null}}],"retailerPrices":[{"id":"4c49cd8f-eabf-47c1-8a42-bc6a2b2328e7","productId":"686055e9-b1ca-4efc-b60c-e0fa49208cb3","retailerId":"3bb9428e-22e9-48ef-8591-ac4f383ac247","countryId":"37640b00-904f-4b4d-a385-bc7f8275eb25","price":235,"shipping":8.9,"inStock":true,"isPreOrder":true,"url":"https://www.lacitedesnuages.be/en/14304-model-color-basic-70172-box-set.html","couponCode":null,"lastChecked":"2025-04-06T11:16:48.569Z","createdAt":"2025-04-06T11:16:48.569Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:12.789Z","deletedAt":null,"currency":"EUR","regionId":null,"retailer":{"id":"3bb9428e-22e9-48ef-8591-ac4f383ac247","name":"La Cit√© des Nuages","slug":"la-cite-des-nuages","logo":null,"website":null,"isActive":true,"createdAt":"2025-03-28T17:28:51.870Z","updatedAt":"2025-03-28T17:28:51.870Z","deletedAt":null,"description":null,"shipping":0,"affiliateCode":null,"affiliateParamKey":null,"useAffiliateCode":false}}],"productMSRPs":[],"brand":{"id":"21ae7000-6836-4501-a6c6-4490a0eb7e37","name":"Vallejo","slug":"vallejo","description":"Auto-imported brand: Vallejo","createdAt":"2025-04-16T23:00:09.074Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-18T17:01:37.111Z","deletedAt":null},"franchise":null,"series":null,"line":null,"images":[{"url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/lcdn-products/5/2/6/6/6/52666-large_default.webp","caption":null,"order":1},{"url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/lcdn-products/5/2/6/6/7/52667-large_default.webp","caption":null,"order":2}],"brandName":"Vallejo","brandSlug":"vallejo","franchiseName":null,"franchiseSlug":null,"seriesName":null,"seriesSlug":null,"lineName":null,"lineSlug":null,"retailerPricesIds":["4c49cd8f-eabf-47c1-8a42-bc6a2b2328e7"],"productMSRPsIds":[]}
