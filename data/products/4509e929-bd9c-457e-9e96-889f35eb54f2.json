Tell me! » <br /><br />-Camus to Hyoga.<br /><br />After <strong>Deathmask</strong>, a new <strong>Athenas</strong> Saint rises to strengthen <strong>Tsume's Saint Seiya</strong>'s collection. Part of the 12 Gold Saints, and master of the absolute zero give your iciest welcome to <strong>Aquarius Camus</strong>!<br /><br />Cold and insensitive at first sight, his blue eyes as deep as the ocean, his icy gaze and his determined expression only confirm this first impression: he perfectly masters the absolute zero emotion. Like a raging sea in the middle of the storm, his long turquoise hair with luminous reflections, as well as his cape, flutter and fly away as the violent winter wind, released during its icy attack, blows. Camus wears his gold cloth, carefully varnished by our painters: this one reveals the upper part of his bare arms, while the center of his helmet is ornamented with a sea-green jewel.<br /><br />We observe here the Gold Saint as hes carrying out his most terrible attack: the Aurora Execution, a phenomenal energy wave able to approach the closest to absolute zero, or -273.15°C. Camus concentrates his cosmos to the maximum, legs apart, his hands and arms forming an amphora. We see the immense spectral figure of Aquarius rising up behind him. Made in translucent resin, this woman with fine features and long hair, wearing a draped dress and bracelets, displays monochrome tones. Overlooking the Aquarius Saint, she particularly highlights the brightness and warmth of his outfits colours. This spiritual appearance in white and light blue, seems to protect and support the ultimate attack of Camus. Kneeling behind him, she carries with both hands a jar with metallic highlights, filled with a golden liquid that she is about to pour. The imposing clear resin ice peaks rising from the frozen ground only confirm that cold reality: no matter can withstand the sinister caress of this icy kiss ...<br /><br />The statue comes with a numbered plate and a certificate of authenticity.        <br /><br />Scale 1/6 <b>Total run of 2500 pieces</b>.          <br /><br />Artistic direction: Cyril Marchiol, Saesa Kiyokawa, Jon Gonzalez Arroyo<br /><br />Concept art: Marijke Wilms<br /><br />Technical engineering: Jose Ku Chio Lu<br /><br />3D sculptors: Carlos Cruz, Olivier Sam, Eliott Lemaire, Patrick Tran, Muhammet Ay<br /><br />Figurine preparators: Aude Pastor, Aurélie Nagot, Tom Fargnier, Guillaume Hemery<br /><br />Painters: Micka Gros, Eric Jolivalt<br /><br />Size: H: 46cm ;
