The Earth is calling. The people are calling. Calling on me to defeat evil. I am the warrior of justice, Masked Rider Stronger!\"\n\nEveryone assemble! The seven Masked Rider!!\nMasked Rider Stronger, the last of the Seven Riders of Glory, is finally available in the Shinkocchou Seihou series!\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe figure's shaping starts with its skeleton to create a completely faithful rendition of Masked Rider Stronger as he appeared in the show during its original run. The mask equipped huge horns \"Kabuto Shock\" and large compound eyes \"Big Eye\", and the inverted triangular massive body shape with its protector \"Kabutector\" covering the upper body, were shaped to ensure an accurate representation of the character. Impeccable attention to detail was paid in the design of each part of the figure, even down to the intricate wrinkles all over his body and the textured surface of the Kabutector.\n\nThe scarf, including the portion around his neck, is made entirely with fabric with new specifications in order to better capture the natural look seen on the show. Wire in the inner part of the fabric that hangs from his neck can be used to create a broad range of expressions, such as the look of the scarf fluttering in the wind.\n\nA portion of the Kabutector that covers the figure's upper body is made of soft material. The Kabutector is divided into chest, shoulder, and hip joint sections, with each section connected by ball joints, allowing flexible movement both vertically and horizontally. The skirt portion is made with soft material as well, enabling a full range of hip joint motion. This makes even the kneeling pose he makes when unleashing his signature move Electro Fire possible.\n\nIn addition to exchangeable hand parts for his main poses, such as his self-introduction and knifehand strike, hand parts are also included to recreate his electrical energy techniques, such as the anti-magnetic ray and reverse fan. Every detail of the activation scene of Masked Rider Stronger's distinctive electricity-based techniques can be accurately recreated.\nHand parts for the hands-on-hips pose unique to Showa-era Riders are included as well. This lets you recreate his most heroic-looking standing poses. Furthermore, another set of hand parts allows you to reproduce the pose where he points at his opponent, which was one of the trademark Showa-era Rider poses. With these parts, you can recreate various scenes from the show.\n\nTo commemorate 50 years of Masked Rider Stronger, a great warrior whose glory never fades, he has now joined the ranks of the Shinkocchou Seihou series!!","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"model":null,"releaseDate":null,"image":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2611065001001_010.jpg","condition":null,"edition":null,"rarity":null,"features":null,"specifications":null,"createdAt":"2025-04-03T23:40:42.060Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-15T15:37:28.078Z","barcode":"97621e51-36c1-4a2a-83d9-ba32d5a51340","deletedAt":null,"source":"scraped","hasFakeBarcode":true,"duplicateId":null,"brandId":"9666dbf2-4fd0-4a71-93f5-559c909f5890","franchiseId":null,"seriesId":null,"lineId":null,"categories":[{"productId":"c589ff78-23a0-4f0f-b650-a9d48d5cf708","categoryId":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","category":{"id":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","name":"Collectibles","slug":"collectibles","description":"Collectible items","image":null,"parentId":null,"createdAt":"2025-03-27T23:28:51.587Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:28.529Z","deletedAt":null}}],"retailerPrices":[{"id":"17170455-1562-4cfd-a0b5-e6764af33c0a","productId":"c589ff78-23a0-4f0f-b650-a9d48d5cf708","retailerId":"8e967743-b1d4-446e-bd1d-25379fdc7dc6","countryId":"cfa253f4-b9e1-4488-9eba-3ea3f0834e01","price":90,"shipping":9.99,"inStock":true,"isPreOrder":true,"url":"https://p-bandai.com/us/item/N2611065001001","couponCode":null,"lastChecked":"2025-04-03T23:40:43.766Z","createdAt":"2025-04-03T23:40:43.766Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:13.103Z","deletedAt":null,"currency":"USD","regionId":null,"retailer":{"id":"8e967743-b1d4-446e-bd1d-25379fdc7dc6","name":"Premium Bandai","slug":"premium-bandai","logo":null,"website":null,"isActive":true,"createdAt":"2025-04-03T23:40:34.094Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-03T23:40:34.094Z","deletedAt":null,"description":null,"shipping":0,"affiliateCode":null,"affiliateParamKey":null,"useAffiliateCode":false}}],"productMSRPs":[],"brand":{"id":"9666dbf2-4fd0-4a71-93f5-559c909f5890","name":"S.H.Figuarts (SHINKOCCHOU SEIHOU)","slug":"shfiguarts-shinkocchou-seihou","description":"S.H.Figuarts (SHINKOCCHOU SEIHOU)","createdAt":"2025-04-03T23:40:42.034Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-15T15:38:41.236Z","deletedAt":null},"franchise":null,"series":null,"line":null,"images":[{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2611065001001_001.jpg","caption":null,"order":1},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2611065001001_002.jpg","caption":null,"order":2},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2611065001001_003.jpg","caption":null,"order":3},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2611065001001_004.jpg","caption":null,"order":4},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2611065001001_005.jpg","caption":null,"order":5},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2611065001001_006.jpg","caption":null,"order":6},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2611065001001_007.jpg","caption":null,"order":7},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2611065001001_008.jpg","caption":null,"order":8},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2611065001001_009.jpg","caption":null,"order":9},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2611065001001_010.jpg","caption":null,"order":10}],"brandName":"S.H.Figuarts (SHINKOCCHOU SEIHOU)","brandSlug":"shfiguarts-shinkocchou-seihou","franchiseName":null,"franchiseSlug":null,"seriesName":null,"seriesSlug":null,"lineName":null,"lineSlug":null,"retailerPricesIds":["17170455-1562-4cfd-a0b5-e6764af33c0a"],"productMSRPsIds":[]}
