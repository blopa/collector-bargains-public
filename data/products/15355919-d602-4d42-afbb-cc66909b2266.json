{"id":"15355919-d602-4d42-afbb-cc66909b2266","name":"S.H.Figuarts GALACTRON","slug":"shfiguarts-galactron","description":"Civil Judgementer Galactron, coming from \"Ultraman Orb\" and \"Ultraman Geed\", is now available from S.H. Figuarts!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t●Shape & Proportions\nWith the cooperation of the Tsuburaya Productions Modeling Department LSS, this figure captures the overwhelming volume and intricate design of the suit as seen in the series with a height of approximately 160mm. The distinctive features of the suit are all here, from the intricately shaped head with dragon motif and mosaic-like molding of the armor, to the fibrous joints.\n\n●Coloring\nThe pure white body that exudes the aura of a divine \"enforcer of justice\" is reproduced with stunning accuracy. Even the most minute details, down to the gold patterns on the horns, have been captured with precise coloring. The hue of the hold parts and the heavy, metallic feel of the silver parts have all been painstakingly crafted to create an overall finish with striking presence.\n\n●Movement\nThe joints throughout the figure's body have high mobility while still retaining accurate proportions. The mouth can be opened and closed, the claw on the right arm can be deployed, and \"Galactron Blade\" on the left arm can be rotated to put the figure into an attacking state. \"Galactron Shaft\" that extends from the back of the head also has joints at each section for enhanced flexibility. The claw at the tip opens and closes as well, so you can recreates scenes when it grabs and picks up its opponents.\n\n●Accessories\nExchangeable parts are included to a recreate the scene where Galactron's right arm is detached and fired. A joint is included to connect the detached right arm to\" Tamashii Stage Act Humanoid \"(sold separately) for display.\n\n●Scene Re-Creation\nPair this figure with others from the S.H. Figuarts Ultraman Series (sold separately) and relive the action-packed battles from the show!","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"model":null,"releaseDate":null,"image":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785277001001_021.jpg","condition":null,"edition":null,"rarity":null,"features":null,"specifications":null,"createdAt":"2025-04-03T23:41:23.500Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-15T15:37:28.194Z","barcode":"0d46e081-fa50-4d7a-bd19-a3dc431c9ed1","deletedAt":null,"source":"scraped","hasFakeBarcode":true,"duplicateId":null,"brandId":"64975266-0e25-4c5e-8a12-4166f7e74f8a","franchiseId":null,"seriesId":null,"lineId":null,"categories":[{"productId":"15355919-d602-4d42-afbb-cc66909b2266","categoryId":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","category":{"id":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","name":"Collectibles","slug":"collectibles","description":"Collectible items","image":null,"parentId":null,"createdAt":"2025-03-27T23:28:51.587Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:28.529Z","deletedAt":null}}],"retailerPrices":[{"id":"0358fc63-5481-43f6-96de-914f92fb702d","productId":"15355919-d602-4d42-afbb-cc66909b2266","retailerId":"8e967743-b1d4-446e-bd1d-25379fdc7dc6","countryId":"cfa253f4-b9e1-4488-9eba-3ea3f0834e01","price":180,"shipping":9.99,"inStock":true,"isPreOrder":false,"url":"https://p-bandai.com/us/item/N2785277001001","couponCode":null,"lastChecked":"2025-04-03T23:41:25.487Z","createdAt":"2025-04-03T23:41:25.487Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:13.103Z","deletedAt":null,"currency":"USD","regionId":null,"retailer":{"id":"8e967743-b1d4-446e-bd1d-25379fdc7dc6","name":"Premium Bandai","slug":"premium-bandai","logo":null,"website":null,"isActive":true,"createdAt":"2025-04-03T23:40:34.094Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-03T23:40:34.094Z","deletedAt":null,"description":null,"shipping":0,"affiliateCode":null,"affiliateParamKey":null,"useAffiliateCode":false}}],"productMSRPs":[],"brand":{"id":"64975266-0e25-4c5e-8a12-4166f7e74f8a","name":"Bandai Tamashii Nations","slug":"bandai-tamashii-nations","description":"Auto-imported brand: Bandai Tamashii Nations","createdAt":"2025-03-27T23:35:43.470Z","updatedAt":"2025-03-27T23:35:43.470Z","deletedAt":null},"franchise":null,"series":null,"line":null,"images":[{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785277001001_012.jpg","caption":null,"order":1},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785277001001_013.jpg","caption":null,"order":2},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785277001001_014.jpg","caption":null,"order":3},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785277001001_015.jpg","caption":null,"order":4},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785277001001_016.jpg","caption":null,"order":5},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785277001001_017.jpg","caption":null,"order":6},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785277001001_018.jpg","caption":null,"order":7},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785277001001_019.jpg","caption":null,"order":8},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785277001001_020.jpg","caption":null,"order":9},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785277001001_021.jpg","caption":null,"order":10}],"brandName":"Bandai Tamashii Nations","brandSlug":"bandai-tamashii-nations","franchiseName":null,"franchiseSlug":null,"seriesName":null,"seriesSlug":null,"lineName":null,"lineSlug":null,"retailerPricesIds":["0358fc63-5481-43f6-96de-914f92fb702d"],"productMSRPsIds":[]}
