{"id":"cffdd9e0-0087-4672-9dd0-c15309dbf2cb","name":"Yu-Gi-Oh! 25th Anniversary Rarity Collection II Booster - Pre order","slug":"yu-gi-oh-25th-anniversary-rarity-collect","description":"Last year&rsquo;s 25th Anniversary Rarity Collection blew everyone&rsquo;s socks off, so we started work on a sequel right away. In order to get it out as fast as we can, we&rsquo;ve made some changes to the configuration while leaving all the good stuff (and value!) intact.25th Anniversary Rarity Collection II packs have twice as many Ultra &amp; Secret Rares per pack, which gives you twice as many chances at &ldquo;luxury rares&rdquo; per pack (Quarter Century Secret Rares, &ldquo;Prismatic&rdquo;-style Ultimate &amp; Collector&rsquo;s Rares, and Platinum Rares)!We&rsquo;ve cut back on the packaging, so there will be fewer packs you&rsquo;ll need to open (and fewer foil wrappers to throw away) to get the same number of the cards you&rsquo;re looking for. (And with double the cards per pack, about two-thirds of packs should have at least one &ldquo;luxury rare&rdquo;, this time, and around a third should have more than one. You could even get up to SIX &ldquo;luxury rares&rdquo; in the same pack, this time around!)If you missed out on the first Rarity Collection, here&rsquo;s how it works: Every card in the set is available in every rarity, with 3 &ldquo;standard&rdquo; rarities (Super Rare, Ultra rare, Secret Rare), and four special &ldquo;luxury&rsquo;&rdquo; rarities: Quarter Century Secret Rares (celebrating the 25th anniversary with tons of sparkle and a watermark logo!), Platinum Secret Rares, &ldquo;Prismatic&rdquo;-style Collector&rsquo;s Rares (previously available only overseas), and &ldquo;Prismatic&rdquo;-style Ultimate Rares (with special 3D varnish, and also available only overseas until recently).Opening Rarity Collection packs is a rapid-fire waterfall of high-powered cards, in seven of the game&rsquo;s most popular foil rarities. If you haven&rsquo;t experienced this all-foil extravaganza yet, you&rsquo;re in for a treat!Each pack will contain: 2 Secret Rares (each with an individual 1-in-4 chance of being upgraded to a Platinum Secret Rare or Quarter Century Secret Rare) 4 Ultra Rares (each with an individual 1-in-6 chance of being upgraded to a new &ldquo;Prismatic&rdquo;-style Collector&rsquo;s Rare or new &ldquo;Prismatic&rdquo;-style Ultimate Rare) 3 Super Rares.ALL CARDS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE FIRST RARITY COLLECTION! Here&rsquo;s just a quick look at some of what you can find:&bull; Hard-to-Find tournament powerhouses like Accesscode Talker and Magicians&rsquo; Souls!&bull; Silent Magician &amp; Silent Swordsman, available for the first time in eight years! And just in time for the brand-new &ldquo;Silent&rdquo; cards coming in April&rsquo;s Legacy of Destruction booster set.&bull; Cards that will glisten and gleam in your hand as they wait for the perfect moment to seal your victory! Tournament mainstays like Droll &amp; Lock Bird and Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit, plus Ghost Mourner &amp; Moonlit Chill and Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay!&bull; The interstellar Field Spell Cards from the competitive &ldquo;Visas Starfrost&rdquo; story Decks: Primitive Planet Reichphobia, Primeval Planet Perlereino, Pressured Planet Wraitsoth, and Peaceful Planet Calarium!Variant art!
