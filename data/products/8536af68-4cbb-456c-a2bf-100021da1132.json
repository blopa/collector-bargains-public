To counter this threat, Saori Kido, Athena's reincarnation, travels to Poseidon's underwater sanctuary, where she is imprisoned in the central pillar, absorbing the waters to delay the flood. The Bronze Knights, led by Seiya, dive into the underwater realm to rescue Athena. They must confront Poseidon's Generals, each guarding a pillar supporting the oceans. During intense battles, they discover that Kanon, Saga of Gemini's twin brother, is manipulating Poseidon in the shadows.</p>\n<p>This vinyl adapts the third arc of the series, the Poseidon arc. Seiji Yokoyama continues to thrill us with the sound of his mandolin, and the Mediterranean accents of this OST give it that characteristic, highly recognizable feel that fits perfectly with the 3rd season of the Knights of the Zodiac.</p>","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"model":null,"releaseDate":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/lcdn-products/4/7/9/2/5/1/479251-large_default.webp","condition":null,"edition":null,"rarity":null,"features":null,"specifications":null,"createdAt":"2025-04-06T11:19:11.101Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-18T16:47:55.093Z","barcode":"3701627801496","deletedAt":null,"source":"heo","hasFakeBarcode":false,"duplicateId":null,"brandId":"5d8b9af8-5ef2-4b4f-a69f-3305a6ed3c9e","franchiseId":null,"seriesId":null,"lineId":null,"categories":[{"productId":"8536af68-4cbb-456c-a2bf-100021da1132","categoryId":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","category":{"id":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","name":"Collectibles","slug":"collectibles","description":"Collectible items","image":null,"parentId":null,"createdAt":"2025-03-27T23:28:51.587Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:28.529Z","deletedAt":null}}],"retailerPrices":[{"id":"ccc93d51-44e3-457a-b2c9-77123979b04d","productId":"8536af68-4cbb-456c-a2bf-100021da1132","retailerId":"3bb9428e-22e9-48ef-8591-ac4f383ac247","countryId":"37640b00-904f-4b4d-a385-bc7f8275eb25","price":39.99,"shipping":8.9,"inStock":true,"isPreOrder":true,"url":"https://www.lacitedesnuages.be/en/55618-saint-seiya-vinyle-soundtrack-music-collection-vol7-1x.html","couponCode":null,"lastChecked":"2025-04-06T11:19:11.646Z","createdAt":"2025-04-06T11:19:11.645Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:12.789Z","deletedAt":null,"currency":"EUR","regionId":null,"retailer":{"id":"3bb9428e-22e9-48ef-8591-ac4f383ac247","name":"La Cité des Nuages","slug":"la-cite-des-nuages","logo":null,"website":null,"isActive":true,"createdAt":"2025-03-28T17:28:51.870Z","updatedAt":"2025-03-28T17:28:51.870Z","deletedAt":null,"description":null,"shipping":0,"affiliateCode":null,"affiliateParamKey":null,"useAffiliateCode":false}}],"productMSRPs":[],"brand":{"id":"5d8b9af8-5ef2-4b4f-a69f-3305a6ed3c9e","name":"Microids Records","slug":"microids-records","description":null,"createdAt":"2025-04-18T16:47:55.074Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-18T17:18:20.393Z","deletedAt":null},"franchise":null,"series":null,"line":null,"images":[{"url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/lcdn-products/4/7/9/2/5/0/479250-large_default.webp","caption":null,"order":1},{"url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/lcdn-products/4/7/9/2/4/9/479249-large_default.webp","caption":null,"order":2},{"url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/lcdn-products/4/7/9/2/5/2/479252-large_default.webp","caption":null,"order":3},{"url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/lcdn-products/4/7/9/2/5/1/479251-large_default.webp","caption":null,"order":4}],"brandName":"Microids Records","brandSlug":"microids-records","franchiseName":null,"franchiseSlug":null,"seriesName":null,"seriesSlug":null,"lineName":null,"lineSlug":null,"retailerPricesIds":["ccc93d51-44e3-457a-b2c9-77123979b04d"],"productMSRPsIds":[]}
