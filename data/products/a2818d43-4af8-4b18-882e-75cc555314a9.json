Iron Studios bring the statue \"Quantumania Ant-Man - Quantuma\u0002nia - Art Scale 1/10\", with the miniature Avenger ready for action over a platform base inspired by the architecture of the futuristic city Axia from the Quantum Realm, based on the 31st movie in the MCU, where Scott Lang and his family face the threat of Kang, the Conqueror.\n\nIn his giant form, the avenger hero brings Cassie Lang on his right shoulder, his now-grown-up daughter with her own costume as the heroine Stature, and his beloved partner Hope van Dyne, the Wasp, clapping her wings and flying over his left shoulder. Over a detailed base with technological and futuristic elements that refer to Axia, a city established in the Quantum Realm, Iron Studios also bring the statue \"Quantumania Ant-Man and the Wasp Deluxe - Quantumania - Art Scale 1/10\".\n\nScott Lang is the second Ant-Man; a reformed ex-criminal that upon discovering that his daughter Cassie has been diagnosed with a serious heart condition, broke into the house of Dr. Henry Pym, the original Ant-Man, and stole his costume and the \"Pym Particles\", the substance that allows him to alter his size, and got back to stealing to pay for the treatment. Lang planned to return the costume to his owner and turn himself in, but after rescuing a doctor that saved his daughter, Henry Pym allowed him to stay with the costume, as long as he used it for good. Since then, Scott, together with Hope van Dyne, the daughter of Dr. Pym that became the hero Wasp, became an Avenger and fought against Thanos' threat. In the first movie of Phase Five of the MCU, when Cassie Lang, now a\nteenager, reveals to Hope's parents, Dr. Pym and Janet van Dyne, that she is working on a satellite that can contact the Quantum Realm, Janet, who was exiled for a long time in this universe, distressed, try to turn off the device, but a portal is opened, pulling Scott, Cassie, Hope, Pym, and Janet to the Quantum Realm. There, Scott and Cassie find a rebel alliance called Freedom Fighters, while Hope and Pym are guided by Janet in the city of Axia. Kang, a formerly exiled traveler, is now\nthe ruler of the Realm and needs the Pym Particles to put in his ship and an online device that allows him to go anywhere and at any time\n\nSize: 10 cm","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"model":null,"releaseDate":null,"image":"https://www.merchoid.com/media/catalog/product/cache/ff6cf93a278e35b621122d56a3a1be9e/m/a/marvel-ant-man-quantumania-art-scale-statue-1-10-mcu-infinity-saga-10cm-1.jpg","condition":null,"edition":null,"rarity":null,"features":null,"specifications":null,"createdAt":"2025-04-17T10:22:12.983Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-17T10:22:12.998Z","barcode":"618231953172","deletedAt":null,"source":"heo","hasFakeBarcode":false,"duplicateId":null,"brandId":"672221c7-6c24-4290-b794-c6cca3ace414","franchiseId":"bf559c2f-32e8-4713-b77b-89d9234ef178","seriesId":null,"lineId":null,"categories":[{"productId":"a2818d43-4af8-4b18-882e-75cc555314a9","categoryId":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","category":{"id":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","name":"Collectibles","slug":"collectibles","description":"Collectible items","image":null,"parentId":null,"createdAt":"2025-03-27T23:28:51.587Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:28.529Z","deletedAt":null}}],"retailerPrices":[{"id":"f1967f01-f956-448b-bd68-d4da0a3abebd","productId":"a2818d43-4af8-4b18-882e-75cc555314a9","retailerId":"1f7a3891-8fef-4c6c-a126-a2b4ba9e899a","countryId":"2801967a-360d-4f35-b27c-e3d5ca481d8d","price":270.99,"shipping":8.9,"inStock":true,"isPreOrder":false,"url":"https://www.merchoid.com/nl/marvel-ant-man-quantumania-art-scale-statue-1-10-mcu-infinity-saga-10cm/","couponCode":null,"lastChecked":"2025-04-17T10:22:13.252Z","createdAt":"2025-04-17T10:22:13.250Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:12.816Z","deletedAt":null,"currency":"EUR","regionId":null,"retailer":{"id":"1f7a3891-8fef-4c6c-a126-a2b4ba9e899a","name":"Merchoid Netherlands","slug":"merchoid-netherlands","logo":null,"website":null,"isActive":true,"createdAt":"2025-03-28T18:07:01.635Z","updatedAt":"2025-03-28T18:07:01.635Z","deletedAt":null,"description":null,"shipping":0,"affiliateCode":null,"affiliateParamKey":null,"useAffiliateCode":false}}],"productMSRPs":[],"brand":{"id":"672221c7-6c24-4290-b794-c6cca3ace414","name":"Iron Studios","slug":"iron-studios","description":"Auto-imported brand: Iron Studios","createdAt":"2025-03-28T00:51:02.323Z","updatedAt":"2025-03-28T00:51:02.323Z","deletedAt":null},"franchise":{"id":"bf559c2f-32e8-4713-b77b-89d9234ef178","name":"Marvel","slug":"marvel","description":"Auto-imported theme: Marvel","createdAt":"2025-03-27T23:31:34.643Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:31.483Z","deletedAt":null},"series":null,"line":null,"images":[{"url":"https://www.heomedia.com/img/nrm/d_is80623.jpg","caption":null,"order":1},{"url":"https://www.merchoid.com/media/catalog/product/cache/ff6cf93a278e35b621122d56a3a1be9e/m/a/marvel-ant-man-quantumania-art-scale-statue-1-10-mcu-infinity-saga-10cm-1.jpg","caption":null,"order":2}],"brandName":"Iron Studios","brandSlug":"iron-studios","franchiseName":"Marvel","franchiseSlug":"marvel","seriesName":null,"seriesSlug":null,"lineName":null,"lineSlug":null,"retailerPricesIds":["f1967f01-f956-448b-bd68-d4da0a3abebd"],"productMSRPsIds":[]}
