{"id":"17225c36-37cb-4339-a265-c8a04316b81f","name":"S.H.Figuarts KAMEN RIDER VRAM PUDDING CUSTOM","slug":"shfiguarts-kamen-rider-vram-pudding-cust","description":"\"Well... Let's do this.\"\nThe third Kamen Rider, Kamen Rider Vram Pudding Custom from \"Kamen Rider Gavv\" is now available from S.H.Figuarts series!\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHis distinctive pudding motif is faithfully recreated in the design of this figure. The bright yellow and orange coloring is reproduced with incredible accuracy. The body is finished in matte black and gunmetal coloring, with different textures for each part of the body. The compound eyes on the head are made with clear parts for an appearance very similar to what is seen in the series.\nThe Vrastom Gear on the belt is also made with clear parts, and even the pudding mold that peeks out from the outside into the interior is carefully color-coded. The lever on the Vrastom Gear moves up and down as well. Exchangeable hands made for operating the lever are included, allowing you to recreate special move activation scenes.\nThe figure's joint structure preserves the natural lines of the human body, allowing you to position the figure in natural-looking poses. This makes it possible to recreate the eye-catching, dynamic actions that you see on the show to your liking.\n\nAlso the weapon \"Vram Breaker\"is included. The coloring and design of each part is reproduced with the same color-coding used on the main body, and the blade at the tip can switch between two modes: bow mode and scythe mode.\nThe \"Vram Breaker\" also comes with exchangeable parts that make it possible to pull the rear lever. The carefully crafted design also recreates the changing colors in the window.\nFurthermore, by removing the Doppudding Gochizo from the belt and setting it in the \"Vram Breaker\", you can recreate the scenes where special moves are activated in \"bow mode\".\nFollowing the release of the Gavv and Valen figures, Vram now joins them as the third main Kamen Riders in the S.H. Figuarts Kamen Rider Gavv series! From intense battles between the Riders to the three of them standing side by side, the possibilities of fun have greatly expanded!","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"model":null,"releaseDate":null,"image":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785552001001_009.jpg","condition":null,"edition":null,"rarity":null,"features":null,"specifications":null,"createdAt":"2025-04-03T23:41:16.592Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-15T15:37:28.173Z","barcode":"79afca44-3d6e-4c42-8042-630f10adaa0a","deletedAt":null,"source":"scraped","hasFakeBarcode":true,"duplicateId":null,"brandId":"c338e77f-7a62-4f9c-a6c8-9c5118fb4d26","franchiseId":null,"seriesId":null,"lineId":null,"categories":[{"productId":"17225c36-37cb-4339-a265-c8a04316b81f","categoryId":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","category":{"id":"c6ea4121-907d-426e-8774-80e229d31d4c","name":"Collectibles","slug":"collectibles","description":"Collectible items","image":null,"parentId":null,"createdAt":"2025-03-27T23:28:51.587Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:28.529Z","deletedAt":null}}],"retailerPrices":[{"id":"861ce522-2bd4-4aa8-aa3d-b4ed95ed512b","productId":"17225c36-37cb-4339-a265-c8a04316b81f","retailerId":"8e967743-b1d4-446e-bd1d-25379fdc7dc6","countryId":"cfa253f4-b9e1-4488-9eba-3ea3f0834e01","price":80,"shipping":9.99,"inStock":true,"isPreOrder":true,"url":"https://p-bandai.com/us/item/N2785552001001","couponCode":null,"lastChecked":"2025-04-03T23:41:18.559Z","createdAt":"2025-04-03T23:41:18.558Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:13.103Z","deletedAt":null,"currency":"USD","regionId":null,"retailer":{"id":"8e967743-b1d4-446e-bd1d-25379fdc7dc6","name":"Premium Bandai","slug":"premium-bandai","logo":null,"website":null,"isActive":true,"createdAt":"2025-04-03T23:40:34.094Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-03T23:40:34.094Z","deletedAt":null,"description":null,"shipping":0,"affiliateCode":null,"affiliateParamKey":null,"useAffiliateCode":false}}],"productMSRPs":[],"brand":{"id":"c338e77f-7a62-4f9c-a6c8-9c5118fb4d26","name":"S.H.Figuarts","slug":"shfiguarts","description":"S.H.Figuarts","createdAt":"2025-04-03T23:40:36.653Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-15T15:38:41.230Z","deletedAt":null},"franchise":null,"series":null,"line":null,"images":[{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785552001001_001.jpg","caption":null,"order":1},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785552001001_002.jpg","caption":null,"order":2},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785552001001_003.jpg","caption":null,"order":3},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785552001001_004.jpg","caption":null,"order":4},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785552001001_005.jpg","caption":null,"order":5},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785552001001_006.jpg","caption":null,"order":6},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785552001001_007.jpg","caption":null,"order":7},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785552001001_008.jpg","caption":null,"order":8},{"url":"https://p-bandai.com/img/us/p/m/N2785552001001_009.jpg","caption":null,"order":9}],"brandName":"S.H.Figuarts","brandSlug":"shfiguarts","franchiseName":null,"franchiseSlug":null,"seriesName":null,"seriesSlug":null,"lineName":null,"lineSlug":null,"retailerPricesIds":["861ce522-2bd4-4aa8-aa3d-b4ed95ed512b"],"productMSRPsIds":[]}
