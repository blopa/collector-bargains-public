He is the fusion of the Dinoforce, a team of six Decepticon Pretenders, each transforming into a mechanical dinosaur. The members – Goryu, Kakuryu, Doryu, Rairyu, Yokuryu, and Gairyu – wear biologically inspired armor to disguise their true robot forms.Dinoking is often considered the Japanese counterpart of Monstructor from the Western continuity, although his colors and background differ. In the Legacy United line, Dinoking receives a modern reissue, retooled from the Core Class Volcanicus combiner, finally allowing fans to obtain a contemporary version of this rare and beloved figure.They are often portrayed as less serious and somewhat comedic counterparts to the Dinobots, with a tendency for clumsiness. Despite the set’s name, Dinoking is NOT a Dinobot.","brandId":"f2f38d15-d011-4da9-a162-7e97d9e06904","franchiseId":null,"seriesId":null,"lineId":null,"brandName":"Hasbro","franchiseName":null,"seriesName":null,"lineName":null,"retailerPrices":[{"id":"6e581ca4-8be4-423b-af4d-fd0a84a782f5","productId":"f1749cb9-9525-4945-8cee-4104422fe234","retailerId":"8f11ac17-d4b3-4834-b25d-e43e45466192","countryId":"2801967a-360d-4f35-b27c-e3d5ca481d8d","price":109.99,"shipping":8.9,"inStock":true,"isPreOrder":false,"url":"https://www.tf-robots.nl/en_GB/a-95960432/transformers-legacy/g0181-transformers-legacy-united-dinobot-dinoking-multipack/","couponCode":null,"lastChecked":"2025-04-17T15:03:15.454Z","createdAt":"2025-04-17T15:03:15.453Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:12.934Z","deletedAt":null,"currency":"EUR","regionId":null,"retailer":{"id":"8f11ac17-d4b3-4834-b25d-e43e45466192","name":"TF Robots","slug":"tf-robots","logo":null,"website":null,"isActive":true,"createdAt":"2025-03-29T21:32:49.149Z","updatedAt":"2025-03-29T21:32:49.149Z","deletedAt":null,"description":null,"shipping":0,"affiliateCode":null,"affiliateParamKey":null,"useAffiliateCode":false}}],"productMSRPs":[],"inStock":true,"barcode":"5010996263322"},{"id":"cac0c448-7908-4117-9e99-5855802e24bb","name":"Bandai Metal Robot SMS Wing Gundam Zero 50th Ann.

In order to get it out as fast as we can, we&rsquo;ve made some changes to the configuration while leaving all the good stuff (and value!) intact.25th Anniversary Rarity Collection II packs have twice as many Ultra &amp; Secret Rares per pack, which gives you twice as many chances at &ldquo;luxury rares&rdquo; per pack (Quarter Century Secret Rares, &ldquo;Prismatic&rdquo;-style Ultimate &amp; Collector&rsquo;s Rares, and Platinum Rares)!We&rsquo;ve cut back on the packaging, so there will be fewer packs you&rsquo;ll need to open (and fewer foil wrappers to throw away) to get the same number of the cards you&rsquo;re looking for. (And with double the cards per pack, about two-thirds of packs should have at least one &ldquo;luxury rare&rdquo;, this time, and around a third should have more than one. You could even get up to SIX &ldquo;luxury rares&rdquo; in the same pack, this time around!)If you missed out on the first Rarity Collection, here&rsquo;s how it works: Every card in the set is available in every rarity, with 3 &ldquo;standard&rdquo; rarities (Super Rare, Ultra rare, Secret Rare), and four special &ldquo;luxury&rsquo;&rdquo; rarities: Quarter Century Secret Rares (celebrating the 25th anniversary with tons of sparkle and a watermark logo!), Platinum Secret Rares, &ldquo;Prismatic&rdquo;-style Collector&rsquo;s Rares (previously available only overseas), and &ldquo;Prismatic&rdquo;-style Ultimate Rares (with special 3D varnish, and also available only overseas until recently).Opening Rarity Collection packs is a rapid-fire waterfall of high-powered cards, in seven of the game&rsquo;s most popular foil rarities. If you haven&rsquo;t experienced this all-foil extravaganza yet, you&rsquo;re in for a treat!Each pack will contain: 2 Secret Rares (each with an individual 1-in-4 chance of being upgraded to a Platinum Secret Rare or Quarter Century Secret Rare) 4 Ultra Rares (each with an individual 1-in-6 chance of being upgraded to a new &ldquo;Prismatic&rdquo;-style Collector&rsquo;s Rare or new &ldquo;Prismatic&rdquo;-style Ultimate Rare) 3 Super Rares.ALL CARDS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE FIRST RARITY COLLECTION! Here&rsquo;s just a quick look at some of what you can find:&bull; Hard-to-Find tournament powerhouses like Accesscode Talker and Magicians&rsquo; Souls!&bull; Silent Magician &amp; Silent Swordsman, available for the first time in eight years! And just in time for the brand-new &ldquo;Silent&rdquo; cards coming in April&rsquo;s Legacy of Destruction booster set.&bull; Cards that will glisten and gleam in your hand as they wait for the perfect moment to seal your victory! Tournament mainstays like Droll &amp; Lock Bird and Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit, plus Ghost Mourner &amp; Moonlit Chill and Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay!&bull; The interstellar Field Spell Cards from the competitive &ldquo;Visas Starfrost&rdquo; story Decks: Primitive Planet Reichphobia, Primeval Planet Perlereino, Pressured Planet Wraitsoth, and Peaceful Planet Calarium!Variant art! The &ldquo;biker&rdquo; version of I:P Masquerena and the &ldquo;fierce&rdquo; version of Rescue Cat will now be available in all 7 different rarities! Plus Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess!&bull; Plus dozens and dozens more!&bull; The 25th Anniversary Rarity Collection II is a spectacular all-foil set with 79 unique cards in the set with 2 cards in the set also available as variant art cards.Whether you&rsquo;re a collector or a competitive Duelist, 25th Anniversary Rarity Collection II is full of cards that everyone will want to get their hands on!*Set name and contents are subject to change","brandId":"45f07b53-5195-4be8-bd0f-604b1c0864bd","franchiseId":null,"seriesId":null,"lineId":null,"brandName":"Bandai TCG","franchiseName":null,"seriesName":null,"lineName":null,"retailerPrices":[{"id":"8bdbf93a-0d6d-411f-9d0e-ed01b643b3af","productId":"cffdd9e0-0087-4672-9dd0-c15309dbf2cb","retailerId":"8f11ac17-d4b3-4834-b25d-e43e45466192","countryId":"2801967a-360d-4f35-b27c-e3d5ca481d8d","price":179.99,"shipping":8.9,"inStock":true,"isPreOrder":false,"url":"https://www.tf-robots.nl/en_GB/a-85964933/yu-gi-oh-trading-card-game/yu-gi-oh-25th-anniversary-rarity-collection-ii-booster-pre-order/","couponCode":null,"lastChecked":"2025-04-17T15:10:39.643Z","createdAt":"2025-04-17T15:10:39.641Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T17:16:12.934Z","deletedAt":null,"currency":"EUR","regionId":null,"retailer":{"id":"8f11ac17-d4b3-4834-b25d-e43e45466192","name":"TF Robots","slug":"tf-robots","logo":null,"website":null,"isActive":true,"createdAt":"2025-03-29T21:32:49.149Z","updatedAt":"2025-03-29T21:32:49.149Z","deletedAt":null,"description":null,"shipping":0,"affiliateCode":null,"affiliateParamKey":null,"useAffiliateCode":false}}],"productMSRPs":[],"inStock":true,"barcode":"4012927184042"},{"id":"16373497-fdc4-4609-bfd6-044f7a0bfe8c","name":"MOTU x TMNT: Turtles of Grayskull Action Figure Donatello 14 cm","slug":"motu-x-tmnt-turtles-of-grayskull-actionc","image":"/placeholder.svg","category":"Collectibles","categories":["Collectibles"],"description":"From Mattel's \"Turtles of Grayskull\" series comes this highly articulated and fully posable action figure.
