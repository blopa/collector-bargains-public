1d:T40c,<p><b>Dragon Ball Super </b>Vinyl Soundtrack. <strong>Official product</strong> by <b>Microids Records</b>.</p>
<p>DRAGONBALL SUPER is a Japanese anime produced by Toei Animation Studios. Scripted by original Dragon Ball author Akira Toriyama, it follows his work and begins shortly after my defeat of Boo in Dragon Ball Z.. "Four years after Boo's death, peace has returned to Earth, and everyone is living in peace. Goku has become a farmer, and Vegeta spends time with his family. However, the desire to train and grow stronger never leaves them. Goku goes to train with Master Kaio, who tells him that a powerful enemy has awakened from a 39-year slumber: Beerus, God of Destruction. The latter is looking for a warrior who appeared to him in a dream, the Divine Super Saiyen, against whom he wishes to measure himself." The anime has been broadcast since 2017 in France on Toonami in a censored version, then in an uncensored version 1 month later. There are 131 episodes and 2 features. The anime doesn't resume until 2025.</p>1e:T436,<p><b>Saint Seiya </b>Vinyl Soundtrack. <strong>Official product</strong> by <b>Microids Records</b>.</p>
<p>Saint Seiya returns in a 7th vinyl with the series' legendary composer Seiji Yokoyama.Synopsis: The god of the seas, Poseidon, threatens to submerge the Earth under water. To counter this threat, Saori Kido, Athena's reincarnation, travels to Poseidon's underwater sanctuary, where she is imprisoned in the central pillar, absorbing the waters to delay the flood. The Bronze Knights, led by Seiya, dive into the underwater realm to rescue Athena. They must confront Poseidon's Generals, each guarding a pillar supporting the oceans. During intense battles, they discover that Kanon, Saga of Gemini's twin brother, is manipulating Poseidon in the shadows.</p>
<p>This vinyl adapts the third arc of the series, the Poseidon arc. Seiji Yokoyama continues to thrill us with the sound of his mandolin, and the Mediterranean accents of this OST give it that characteristic, highly recognizable feel that fits perfectly with the 3rd season of the Knights of the Zodiac.</p>1f:T47a,<p><b>Saint Seiya </b>Vinyl Soundtrack. <strong>Official product</strong> by <b>Microids Records</b>.</p>
<p>The music of the Asgard season embodies an epic spirit reminiscent of Norse mythology, intertwining gods and legends.</p>
<p> Hyôga answers Saori's call, alarmed by an imminent danger. Before he can act, however, Saori is attacked by a divine warrior from Asgard, acting under the orders of Hilda of Polaris. Athena then travels to Asgard, setting the stage for a confrontation. To save humanity, she halts the melting of the ice, but only for half a day. During this brief window, Seiya and his companions face off against the seven divine warriors of Asgard to retrieve the Odin sapphires and free Hilda from the Nibelungen ring.</p>
<p>This vinyl adapts the second arc of the series, the Asgard arc, which is original to the anime and does not appear in the manga.  </p>
<p>Melancholy, suspense, menace, sadness, hope, epicness—these are just some of the words that could describe the myriad sensations and emotions evoked by the great Seiji Yokoyama's music, enough to give chills to the most devoted fans of the series.</p>20:T826,<p><b>One Piece </b>Vinyl Original Soundtrack. <strong>Official product</strong> by <b>Microids Records</b>.</p>
