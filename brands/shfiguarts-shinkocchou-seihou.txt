1d:Ta3b,"The heavens are calling. The Earth is calling. The people are calling. Calling on me to defeat evil. I am the warrior of justice, Masked Rider Stronger!"

Everyone assemble! The seven Masked Rider!!
Masked Rider Stronger, the last of the Seven Riders of Glory, is finally available in the Shinkocchou Seihou series!

										The figure's shaping starts with its skeleton to create a completely faithful rendition of Masked Rider Stronger as he appeared in the show during its original run. The mask equipped huge horns "Kabuto Shock" and large compound eyes "Big Eye", and the inverted triangular massive body shape with its protector "Kabutector" covering the upper body, were shaped to ensure an accurate representation of the character. Impeccable attention to detail was paid in the design of each part of the figure, even down to the intricate wrinkles all over his body and the textured surface of the Kabutector.

The scarf, including the portion around his neck, is made entirely with fabric with new specifications in order to better capture the natural look seen on the show. Wire in the inner part of the fabric that hangs from his neck can be used to create a broad range of expressions, such as the look of the scarf fluttering in the wind.

A portion of the Kabutector that covers the figure's upper body is made of soft material. The Kabutector is divided into chest, shoulder, and hip joint sections, with each section connected by ball joints, allowing flexible movement both vertically and horizontally. The skirt portion is made with soft material as well, enabling a full range of hip joint motion. This makes even the kneeling pose he makes when unleashing his signature move Electro Fire possible.

In addition to exchangeable hand parts for his main poses, such as his self-introduction and knifehand strike, hand parts are also included to recreate his electrical energy techniques, such as the anti-magnetic ray and reverse fan. Every detail of the activation scene of Masked Rider Stronger's distinctive electricity-based techniques can be accurately recreated.
Hand parts for the hands-on-hips pose unique to Showa-era Riders are included as well. This lets you recreate his most heroic-looking standing poses. Furthermore, another set of hand parts allows you to reproduce the pose where he points at his opponent, which was one of the trademark Showa-era Rider poses. With these parts, you can recreate various scenes from the show.

To commemorate 50 years of Masked Rider Stronger, a great warrior whose glory never fades, he has now joined the ranks of the Shinkocchou Seihou series!!1e:Ta15,"Budou Arms! Dragon... Cannon... Ha ha ha!"

"KAMEN RIDER RYUGEN BUDOU ARMS" joins the Shinkocchou Seihou series with a brand-new format featuring the Arms Change system! This figure is fully compatible for swapping armor and equipment with the existing S.H.Figuarts (Shinkocchou Seihou) Kamen Rider Gaim series.

										Every detail of the Arms (armor) has been meticulously crafted, down to the intricate folds of the waist drape. The metallic green finish on both the Arms (armor) and the under-suit "Rider Wear" perfectly captures the look and feel of the drama.
The "Bukenkou" shoulder armor features two points of articulation, allowing for outward movement, while the waist drape is made with soft material to preserve articulation. You can enjoy posing Ryugen in different action poses.

This set includes the "Budou Ryuhou" (Grape Dragon Cannon), a handgun-style Arms Weapon, which can be held using dedicated hand parts for added expressiveness. Also included are newly sculpted hand parts exclusive to Ryugen, allowing for even more intense posing. The Budou Ryuhou is equipped with a sliding rear lever, the "Ryokuhou Gekitetsu," and comes with a special hand part designed to grip the lever—perfect for recreating bullet reload and special attacks!

For even more customization, a hand part for operating the Cutting Blade of "Sengoku Driver" is also included. The "Budou Lockseed" comes in two versions—standard and panel-opened—offering interchangeable display options.
The general-purpose hands included allow Ryugen to wield weapons from other S.H.Figuarts (Shinkocchou Seihou) Kamen Rider Gaim figures. You can equip the "Daidaimaru" from the "S.H.Figuarts (Shinkocchou Seihou) Kamen Rider Gaim Orange Arms" (sold separately) to recreate the unforgettable final battle!

Take customization even further by swapping in armor from the "S.H.Figuarts (Shinkocchou Seihou) Kamen Rider Gaim Orange Arms" (sold separately) or "S.H.Figuarts (Shinkocchou Seihou) Kamen Rider Baron Banana Arms" (sold separately) to create "Kamen Rider Ryugen Orange Arms" and "Kamen Rider Ryugen Banana Arms"—forms never seen in the drama! Likewise, the Budou Arms can be equipped onto Gaim or Baron, offering even more possibilities.

For ultimate authenticity, specialized compound eye parts are included, ensuring accurate proportions even for Arms Change forms like "Kamen Rider Baron Banana Arms," where the distance between the compound eyes and head armor differs.

With more Armored Riders joining the Shinkocchou Seihou lineup, the Rider Sengoku Era enters a new stage!5:["$","$L1c",null,{"brand":{"id":"9666dbf2-4fd0-4a71-93f5-559c909f5890","name":"S.H.Figuarts
