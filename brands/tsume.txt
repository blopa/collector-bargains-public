<p>I'm going to crush you along with the rest of the Earth!! Go ahead and try to dodge this if you can! Even if you spare yourself, the Earth will be blown to pieces! Theres absolutly no way you stop my Gyarikku Ho blast!! Let you and the Earth together turn to SPACE DUST!!-<strong>Vegeta</strong><br /><br />- "You are going to WHAT !? Dammit, he thought this through! I aint no choice but to risk it! Times-three Kaio-ken KAMEHAME-HA !!!!"-<strong> Son Goku</strong><br /><br />Relive the first encounter and first clash on Earth between Son Goku, the hero of Dragon Ball Z and Vegeta, the Prince of Saiyans, through the realization of an explosive 1/6 HQS statue!<br /><br />Although these two protagonists share the same origins, they do not share the same purpose, since everything opposes them, especially their convictions! The ruthless anti-hero wants to prove his incontestable superiority at all costs by destroying the planet, its inhabitants and adversary, while the Earths great defender intends to use all his strength to prevent it, fed by a destructive desire for revenge. There is only one solution: to engage in a merciless fight May the strongest win!<br /><br />Determined to protect his family and avenge his friends, Son Goku is determined to let his rage out! In reality, he has no choice, he cannot fail: on his victory depends the survival of humanity. We see him here deploying all his strength and energy to fight and try to defeat the space warrior and Saiyans prince, preparing a fearsome attack taught by his master Kaiō-sama: the Kaio-ken x3! An overpowering and destructive attack that forces him to push his limits, thereby putting his own life in danger!<br /><br />We recognize the place of the clash thanks to the terracotta desert ground painted in a gradation of brown, orange and reddish shades, while we notice that the rocks rise in the air due to the immeasurable energy exerted by Son Goku. The Saiyan's rage and determination can be read in his merciless dark gaze which he keeps fixated on his enemy. He will do everything in his power to save his loved ones this time around: the titanic effort he generates is transcribed through the fierce expression of his grimacing face as well as the muscles of his overdeveloped chest ready to tear themselves apart. The Saiyans super massive and protruding musculature is underlined by the light and shadow effects performed by our painters, while the reddish aura enveloping his entire figure manifests his transformation.<br /><br />The warrior wears his usual orange trousers tightened at the waist by his blue belt floating in the air under the effect of the attack, like his dark hair. His orange and navy blue shoes sink into the ground to stabilize themselves by accumulating as much energy as possible. Cracking the ground under the effect of the energy deployed, legs spread, arms outstretched, he is about to unleash all his power to remind his assailant of the reason why he should never have set foot on this planet. We then see him forming with his hands a sphere of energy in translucent resin in shades of blue, while the immense aura of energy in translucent red resin behind him and the dust suddenly rising from the ground testify to the strength of the shock caused by the attack intended to wipe his opponent from the face of the earth!<br /><br />The blue sphere of energy can be placed or not in the palm of Son Goku's hands thanks to its interchangeable arms, thus showing the Saiyan preparing his attack or even attacking, especially if he is placed in front of the Vegeta HQS statue associated, in order to bring the combat between the two super warriors to life. Likewise, it is possible to replace the blue translucent resin aura to the left of Son Goku and the ones before him with rocks, if he has not yet attacked. Finally, the plinth is equipped with a LED to make the confrontation larger than life and turn the animation into reality.<br /><br />The statue comes with a numbered plate and a certificate of authenticity.<br /><br /><strong>Scale 1/6 Total run of 3000 pieces.</strong><br />This product is not a toy or product for children. It is a collectors item intended for adults only.<br /><br /></p>22:Ta43,<p><b>Dragon Ball Z </b>Statue of <b>Trunks' Time Machine </b>in <b>HQS Dioramax,</b> 1/6 scale size approx.65cm. <strong>Official product</strong> in <strong>limited edition of 1600 pieces</strong> by <strong>Tsume Art</strong>.</p>
<p><em>- « H-O-P-E, Hope ? » - Bulma</em></p>
<p><em>- « Yes! I wrote it just before I left from the future and… You find the exact same thing written on the other capsule! » - Trunks</em></p>
<p>This <strong>HQS Dioramax</strong> statue features <strong>Future Trunks</strong> as he discovers the abandoned time machine on Earth, accompanied by <strong>Gohan</strong> and <strong>Bulma</strong>. Returning to the past in order to save Son Goku and avoid a tragic fate for the planet, he compares this strange discovery with his own and unique machine: these are exactly the same! Wearing his Capsule Corporation jacket, <strong>Trunks</strong> uses his sleeve to clean up the moss that has invaded the abandoned machine, originally yellow and blue. He realizes that under this vegetation, we can read the word "Hope !!", which he had engraved on his machine before traveling in the past ... The doubt is raised! We see in the gaze and attitude of Trunks that he becomes aware of the disaster that the presence of this machine can portend ... Almost completely covered in moss, the status of the machine suggests that it has been here for a long time, or at least enough time for nature to reclaim its rights over its environment. Trunks then noticed the gaping hole in the cockpit in transparent resin, suggesting it had been melted from inside the machine. While trying to decipher this riddle, we find here the two halves of an eggshell, while the on-board computer indicates that the mysterious passenger would have arrived in the timeline of <strong>Son Goku</strong> and his friends 3 years before <strong>Trunks</strong> … Could it be that a life form from the future is lurking on Earth without anyone knowing? In order to be able to observe the entire scene, an electric rotating plate has been integrated into the base of the statue (power supply provided). As Son Gohan sees it in the distance, we can make out the shell of a huge insect that would have molted and left the remains of its old life behind ... The hunt for cyborgs is on, Cell’s evolution has begun ...</p>

<p>This <strong>HQS</strong> statue of <strong>Gohan vs Buu</strong> features Mystic <strong>Gohan</strong> arriving on Earth to face <strong>Super Buu</strong> in the episode « Boo is Overwhelmed!! Gohan’s Miracle Power », being the only one who can save his people and planet! Determined to stop his ruthless opponent in his destructive and murderous madness, he appears here in his ultra-powerful form of Ultimate Warrior, acquired after Elder Kaiōshin unlocked his full potential, as shown by the white aura in transparent resin surrounding him. After annihilating his creators, Super Buu looks forward to eradicating the earth and all life from the universe and will let nothing and no one stand in his joyous mission of total destruction. This more impressive and muscular form of Majin Buu is the result of <strong>Evil Buu</strong> having devoured <strong>Good Buu</strong> in chocolate form. Having become much more powerful with increased mental capacity, the insatiable genius is seized with an extremely dangerous fit of anger, even possessing the power to rip through dimensional walls. </p>
<p>Having opposite goals, the stubborn savior being ready to do anything to protect and the demonic genius stopping at nothing to exterminate absolutely everything, they will face each other in a merciless fight. The phenomenal antagonist giving the Strongest Warrior a hard time, he uses an attack taking his opponent by surprise to literally make him bite the dust. After throwing him violently into the air as evidenced by the sand rising from the ground and the transparent resin clouds he crosses, <strong>Super Gohan</strong> in turn propels himself into the sky, preceded by speed effects. Awaiting his timely encounter overhead with the bewildered pink demon, Ultimate Gohan, looking resolute, deals him the killing blow with a brutal backhand of his fist condemning him to crash at the speed of light against the desert ground, as indicated by the transparent effects trapping his arms or his expression of shock and pain... A good reason to think twice before trying to annihilate an entire galaxy!</p>

<p><em>"You won’t kill me! You’re the one who’s going to die...!</em></p>
<p><em>I can survive in the vacuum of space. How about you?!</em></p>
<p><em>Ha ha ha (...) This planet is finished!!!!"</em></p>
<p><em>- Frieza to Son Goku </em></p>
<p>This typical landscape, with its luminous green water and blue hills, indicates that the Galactic Tyrant is on <strong>Namek</strong>, the home planet of the Nameless Namekian, where he travels with the aim of finding the <strong>Dragons Balls</strong>.</p>
<p>Greedily decimating every village on his way, we can see him here deploying all his strength to exterminate his fierce opponent: <strong>Son Goku</strong>! Determined to annihilate him, he finally sets out to destroy the entire planet in order to win his fight against the <strong>Super Saiyan</strong>.</p>
<p>Being able to survive in space, he will sacrifice any life on <strong>Namek</strong>’s surface, for his greatest pleasure! Thus, through his aura and in his final form, the sadistic tyrant creates an exponentially powerful Death Ball in transparent resin, in searing blood red tones, illuminated and surrounded by dark lightning. Respecting the very essence of <strong>Frieza</strong>, his pose, both iconic and unique, shows him carrying death at arm’s length. His murderous madness and visceral desire for total destruction animates his bloodthirsty gaze as he is preparing to annihilate this planet by projecting all his devastating power into its heart ...</p>
<p>Then, the dying planet turns into a ticking time bomb, which in only 5 minutes, will be defused and swallowed up by the inhospitable coldness and interstellar vacuum of space.</p>
<p>The immeasurable power of the impact generates shock waves capable of lifting the ocean’s waters, here in transparent resin and green shades, while the magnificent mountain plains of this suffocating planet gradually crumble into the oblivion of the darkest, vastest and most bruised of all oceans, that of an infinite nothingness!</p>

His sacrifice will trigger events with numerous consequences.<br /><br />This is our first incursion in Akira Toriyama's world, and we chose, Son Gohan &amp; Piccolo. The sculpture's details shows a very high resemblance, especially with the face and the muscles, whose are very specific to this art. Piccolo has both his arms stretched and he's receiving head-on Nappa's murderous move. His face is distorted because of the pain he feels. His outfit starts shredding. Gohan is in chock when he realise that his mentor is about to sacrifice himself to save him. Standing still, his arms are both up, to protect his face. And due to Piccolo's protection, he only bears the marks of his previous fight with Nappa.<br /><br />The base of our HQS by Tsume statue is mimicking the dirt where the characters are fighting. A dust cloud is created by Nappa's attack. There still is our usual style with a beveled black base, but the nameplate is replaced with a bas-relief of the show's logo with a transluscent resin Dragon Ball!<br /><br />Numbered Edition: 2500 pieces.

He then unleashes a devastating attack that kills in one fell swoop three of the six Saibaimen who were attacking his friends. It's a cult moment and one of a few that shows how powerful this character is. This is the reason why we wanted to adapt this scene into a statue, even if it meant going back a little bit in the chronology of our statues of the Dragon Ball Z series.<br /><br />The sculpture is all about dynamism, centered on Krillin, while the monsters explode in pieces around him. Each wave of light is enhanced by a system of LEDs and small details such as the Saibaimen that stumbles off the base, or the eye that comes out of its orbit, make this scene quite realistic.<br /><br />The coloring is consistent with the previous statues of the series, with a dominant of ocher and orange hues on the base and Krillin, while contrasting with the green colors of the Saibaimen.<br /><br />The statue comes with a numbered plate and a certificate of authenticity.<br /><br />Scale 1/6 <b>Total run of 2000 pieces</b>.<br /><br />Size: H: 55 cm, W: 55cm, D: 55 cm<br /><br />© Bird Studio / Shueisha, Toei Animation</p>28:T679,<p><strong>DRAGON BALL Z</strong><span> Statue </span><span>of</span><span> </span><strong>Broly Legendary Super Saiyan</strong><span> in </span><strong>HQS+ </strong><span><strong>range</strong>, size approx.81cm.</span><span> </span><strong>Official product</strong><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><strong>limited edition</strong><span> by </span><strong>Tsume</strong><span>.</span></p>

<p>-MANIPULATOR-</p>
<p>Kanon, the twin brother of Gemini Saga, has a dark past marked by manipulation and betrayal. Imprisoned by his brother at Cape Sounion due to his misdeeds, he later orchestrated the reincarnation of Poseidon and took on the role of the Sea Dragon General with the goal of world domination. His past is reflected in his base, including the bars of his prison, Poseidon's trident, and the North Atlantic Pillar.</p>
<p>-REDEMPTION-</p>
<p>Despite his past, Kanon shows signs of redemption. He helps the Bronze Saints defeat Poseidon, revealing a deep loyalty to his brother and the ideals of Athena's Saints. He fights alongside them during the Holy War against Hades.</p>
<p>- GOLDEN TRIANGLE -</p>
<p>Kanon's iconic attack creates a golden triangle that traps his opponent in the heart of the Bermuda Triangle, an interdimensional portal in the Saint Seiya universe. This attack is very similar to Gemini's Another Dimension.</p>

Opposed to the Grand Pope and the Gold Saints, they have 12 hours to save Athena and will have to surpass themselves to succeed!<br /><br />The entire MUB base describes this fight. The 12 houses are present there, extremely detailed thanks to the new Micron by Tsume printing process (see below). On the back of the statue, the Clock is faithfully sculpted, counting down the hours. The painting of this base also shows us the passage of time, being vivid in the first houses and darkening as the hours pass towards the Palace of the Grand Pope.</p>
<p>Different LED sequences will allow you to relive the battle of the sanctuary, simulating the fight of our Heroes in rhythm with the Clock.</p>
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL PARTS:</strong></p>
<p>You can thus place a Pegasus wing on Seiya's back. This, located in the extension of Cosmos' Pegasus represents the constellation's transition to Armor.</p>
<p>A Gold arrow can also be displayed on Seiya's back. It symbolizes the Saints' race against time. This arrow, planted in her heart, will kill Athena if our Heroes do not manage to defeat their enemies in time!</p>
<p>Finally, two different logos can be placed on the bust: One in Greek column color and the second in bronze color.</p>
<p><strong>SYSTEME LED</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the LEDs present on the Cosmos Pegasus and the base, several LED sequences are possible on the houses and the Clock:</p>
<p>1) Full Led : static lighting<br />2) Story : Relive the battle of the sanctuary thanks to a countdown from the Clock and the houses representing the battles of the Bronze Saints.<br />3) My Zodiacal Sign : Light up only the house of your choice and the corresponding symbol on the Clock.</p>
<p><strong>INNOVATION:</strong></p>
<p>We have brought something new to eye treatment. Seiya's eyes are made of transparent resin, allowing us to bring an unprecedented depth and shine to our works. The rendering is intended to be much more realistic and lively. This technology, already used on Naruto MUB, will be brought to our other creations depending on the scale.</p>

<p>Following in <strong>Aquarius</strong> <strong>Camus</strong> <strong>HQS</strong>’ footsteps, the formidable Bronze Saint colder and terrible than ice, reinforces the lines of defense of the Goddess of Justice and War : here is <strong>Cygnus Hyôga HQS</strong> by <strong>Tsume</strong>!</p>
<p>This statue traces the story and development of the Graad Foundation orphan and reminds us of his cold first victories! Indeed, the ground covered with frost and peaks of ice in translucent resin ranging from navy blue, to turquoise then to water green, reminds us of the desolate landscapes of Eastern Siberia and its freezing temperatures. It is by destroying this eternal glacier that Hyôga wins the <strong>Cygnus</strong> Cloth and flies towards his destiny, like the <strong>Cygnus</strong>’ representation in transparent resin ensuring his way. Redrawing his course and the obstacles removed since this key moment, we see here the Bronze Saint, as in the Hades chapter, ready for combat, in his V3 myth cloth with metallic reflections and cold green-gray shades, which has been repaired thanks to <strong>Athena's</strong> blood. Using his hands, he is drawing the Cygnus’ constellation, as a light from the dark abyssal depth shoots up to the surface to illuminate his path. This powerful fighter who has grown a lot, is now Seiya's ally and a staunch defender of the Goddess of Wisdom and her just cause! Hidden under his blond hair, we notice the bandage on his injured left eye in repentance to Isaac, during Poseidon's chapter. His cold appearance and ruthless icy blue gaze reflect his innermost nature: although he shows no mercy for his ennemies, he will give his heart and soul to defend his loved ones!</p>
<p>The statue comes with a numbered plate and a certificate of authenticity. </p>

<p>After <strong>Pegasus</strong> and <strong>Andromeda</strong>, a third <strong>Bronze Saint</strong> completes the diorama and defense lines of the<strong> Goddess of Wisdom Athena</strong>: here is <strong>Phoenix</strong> HQS+ by Tsume!</p>
<p>As Andromeda’s elder brother, he covers his backside here and carries out his training on the terrible Death Queen Island to spare Shun, transforming himself into a formidable warrior. In attack position alongside Athena, Ikki wears his Phoenix Bronze Armor earned by assassinating his master Guilty. This armor has regenerative abilities that even Gold Armor does not have. Also, the fiery-tempered Saint has interchangeable arms/effects showing him deploying his Cosmo energy in translucent orange resin, ready to set the battlefield on fire. Adorned with flamboyant reflections, his golden, pink and blue armor goes perfectly with his sea hair and eyes. The red stone adorning his trident-shaped helmet highlights the mighty Saint's fiery gaze of determination. Ikki has an additional head with his blue visor helmet presenting him as he appears in the first episode, his mischievous smile inviting confrontation. Able to be reborn from his own, he will not hesitate to reduce his enemies to ashes.</p>
<p>Behind him is the Metallic Gray Phoenix Pandora Box, as indicated by the bird spreading its wings. The emblems present on the other walls of the box refer to chivalry and the cosmos. One of the pillars of the Temple of Athena collapsed in front of the fearsome Saint, justifying his attack position. Looking at the ground of the sanctuary, we can then distinguish the Phoenix constellation engraved in stone, while we find at the front of the base the emblem of the legendary bird as well as its name written in ancient Greek as on antic temples. The front of the base is interchangeable, allowing the Phoenix plate to appear or not on the rocky ground. Equipped with an additional platform to elevate him, Phoenix Ikki is intended to take place in the diorama composed of Athena and her Bronze Saints, ready to defend the great Protector of the Sanctuary! If the goddess is absent, an additional pillar to be placed behind Shun completes the decor.</p>

It is a collectors item intended for adults only.</p>33:T8e9,<p>Official licensed <strong>Saint Seiya</strong> statue of <strong>Mû</strong> of <strong>Aries</strong> attacking the enemy in the episode "The Group Dressed in Black" of the Sanctuary of Hades Arc. Limited edition of 1200 pieces by<strong> Tsume Art</strong>.</p>
<p>“The Ugly Eruption didn’t work?!“ - Myū</p>
<p>"Take that ! By the Stardust Revolution!!!“ - Mū</p>
<p>This statue represents Aries Mū attacking the enemy in the episode "The Herd of Black Cloaks" from the Hades Arc. As the Gold Saint enters the Cancer House in poor condition after Shaka's attack, he finds himself paralyzed by psychokinesis and surrounded by the 108 Specters of Hades' army, searching for Saga and his companions. As Cyclops Gigant of the Terrestrial Violent Star prepares to deliver the fatal blow, Pegasus Seiya stops him. The energy paralyzing Mū orders the Specter to leave for the Leo Temple, which is how Aries Mū meets Papillon Myū, the Fairy Terrestrial Specter.</p>
<p>Papillon Myū, still in his chrysalis form, wishes to fight the Aries Saint on equal terms and projects its Ugly Eruption in his direction. Fighting at the speed of light and protecting the Bronze Saint, Mū parries the terrible attack with his Crystal Wall, determined to return blow for blow. Looking determined, the brave Aries Gold Saint in his emerald and gold horned cloth is seen here using his powerful " Stardust Revolution" to eradicate the disgusting creature.</p>
<p>OVER 500 HOURS OF SCULPTING, 250 HOURS OF PREPARATION AND 150 HOURS OF PAINTING.</p>
<p>His long lavender hair projected in the air revealing the two marks on his forehead, he summons stardust from stars and galaxies thanks to his Cosmo, seen here behind him in transparent resin with purple and bluish hues, and projects an illuminated shower of star and comets to pulverize his enemy. Under the shock of the attack, we see the pillars of the Cancer Temple shatter into a thousand pieces. The gentle Aries Saint intends to prove to the dark Papillon that whatever his form, he is fatally destined to return to the Kingdom of the Dead, by the Starlight Extinction...</p>

<p>This statue represents <strong>Alioth Epsilon Fenrir</strong> and his wolf <strong>Ging</strong>, inspired in particular by the episode « Bared Fangs! The Northern Wolf Fenrir » from the Asgard arc. While <strong>Athena</strong> prays to <strong>Odin</strong>, King of Asgard, to prevent the ice from melting, her Saints continue their quest for Odin's sapphires, as evoked by the snowy bedrock. This is how <strong>Shiryu</strong> finds himself face to face with Hilda's envoy: <strong>Fenrir</strong>, the Epsilon God Warrior, accompanied by his pack of wolves that will not budge! We see here the God Warrior in the service of <strong>Odin</strong> and <strong>Hilda</strong>, going on the attack in his varnished midnight blue Cloth reminiscent of the eponymous giant wolf from Norse mythology, the son of Loki, God of Mischief. With his arm outstretched in the Dragon Saint's direction, Fenrir temporarily blinds him by assaulting him with his searing « Wolf Cruelty Claw » capable of defeating his opponent's Rozan Shō Ryū Ha!</p>
<p>Concentrating his Cosmo in his fist, the God Warrior then fires it in the form of enormous claws which carve up the enemy at the speed of light, as seen in the pink transparent resin effects. <strong>Fenrir</strong> has two interchangeable heads, one showing his mischievous expression as he brutally lacerates his enemy, the other wearing his helmet with an expression of cold anger. Weakening his fellow man, the Warrior who trusts only wolves will not spare those wild beasts devoid of humanity who once abandoned him : men. Adopted by the wolf pack after rescuing Ging, the blue wolf is loyal to him for life and fights here by his side, swooping down on their foe, looking enraged with bared fangs! This duel thus marks the confrontation between the one who believes in the love of men and the one who has renounced it, a fight between two contradictory ideals that undermine the Bronze Saint...</p>

<p>This statue of <strong>Virgo Shaka</strong> is an interpretation of the episodes "Shaka, the Man closest to God" and "Fear of the void! Shaka opening his eyes" from the Sanctuary arc. As the three <strong>Gold Saint</strong>, <strong>Shiryū</strong>, <strong>Seiya</strong> and <strong>Shun</strong>, arrive at the Maiden's Temple, they find <strong>Shaka</strong> resting on his golden Lotus, ready to duly welcome them. While their host defeats them in a jiffy and prepares to finish off Shun in cold blood, his brother <strong>Ikki</strong> appears and engages in a veritable tug of war with his adversary. After a fierce fight illustrated by the Maiden Temple’s pillar in demolition, the one who claims to be the reincarnation of Buddha will prove that if his soul is of infinite purity, his cruelty is limitless too. </p>
<p>We thus see the ruthless <strong>Gold Saint</strong> in his varnished Gold Cloth, his right arm stretched out towards <strong>Ikki</strong>, using his most terrible power against him: the Treasures of Heavens. Eyes closed and concentrated, we see here the user of the 7th and 8th sense preparing this formidable attack capable of suppressing one by one the senses of his victim, including the 6th of thought. His alternate head shows him with an expression of cold anger as Shaka's opening his eyes and unleashing the full force of his power, as evidenced by the yellow transparent resin energy beams emanating from his hand or his projected golden hair. Thus, the Saint with superhuman powers shows how he is undoubtedly the Man closest to God.</p>

<p>This Ikigai statue shows <strong>Hades</strong> attacking in the <strong>Elysion</strong> Arc, determined to bring <strong>Seiya</strong> and the other Saints into darkness, along with the entire world! The manipulative divinity this time lets glimpse his emotions. His inhuman beauty cannot hide the black anger burning in his icy blue gaze. Expression exacerbated by the contrast between his hair as dark as his soul and his complexion of immaculate whiteness, even cadaverous. Ready to bring them through hell, the King of the Underworld presents them with the sharp blade of his terrible divine weapon. Adorned with writings and multiple light reflections, the <strong>Hades</strong>’ Invisible Sword has in its heart a stone as red as the blood of cursed souls who had the honor of its macabre encounter ... The powerful antagonist wears his divine cloth whose gray tones vary from lightest to darkest, accentuated by the countless bright metallic reflections. The wings on his back recall his status as a god and his superiority. Leaning on his gravestone, his blood-red aura seems to emanate from the rock like an irresistible and fatal call from the depths. The Underworld God is ready to unleash all his rage in this deadly fight!</p>

<p>This Ikigai statue shows <strong>Julian Solo</strong>, the host of <strong>Poseidon</strong>, going on the attack in the <strong>Poseidon</strong> arc. His gaze, as deep as the ocean’s blue, shimmers with fury as he throws his sacred trident at <strong>Saori</strong>, the reincarnation of <strong>Athena</strong>. The Goddess of Wisdom and the God of the Sea, enemies since mythological times, have the same desire: to end this war and the existence of their adversary! The Olympic God wears his divine cloth in gold colors and multiple metallic reflections, whose copper and golden tones merge with those of his favorite weapon. Like his wavy bluish hair, he rests on a raging sea of transparent resin, recalling his status as a King and Master of Oceans, capable of engulfing any opponent! Behind him, partly submerged in water, we can see a fragment of the Main Breadwinner pillar of the Marina sanctuary of <strong>Poseidon</strong>. This pillar, which features the characteristic symbol of the trident, can only be destroyed last, just like its holder! Determined to win this mythical battle, Poseidon intends to use the devastating force of his element to draw his opponent out to sea and drown his hopes of victory!</p>

<p>After <strong>Athena HQS +</strong> and <strong>Pegasus HQS +</strong>, a new Bronze Saint completes the diorama and defense lines of the Goddess of Wisdom: here is <strong>Andromeda HQS + by Tsume!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andromeda Shun</strong> is seen here in a defensive position equipped with the <strong>Andromeda</strong> Chain, holding in his left hand its spherical defensive part and in his right hand its pointed offensive part. He also has interchangeable arms / effects showing him deploying his Cosmo energy in translucent purple resin, energy that the Saint of immense potential and exponential power will only deploy as a last resort. Adorned with light reflections, his varnished armor enhances his pale complexion and contrasts with his long green hair covered by his pink and silver helmet. The escaping hairlocks highlight the hopeful green gaze of the benevolent and peaceful Saint, while his expression does not deny the possibility of a devastating attack if that is the only choice he has.</p>
<p>Behind him is the metallic gray <strong>Andromeda</strong> Pandora Box, as indicated by the bust of the princess shown in profile. The emblems on the other walls of the box refer to chivalry and the cosmos. One of the pillars of the <strong>Athena</strong> Temple collapsed behind the formidable Saint, justifying his defensive position. Looking at the ground of the Sanctuary, we can then distinguish the <strong>Andromeda</strong> constellation engraved in stone, while we find at the front of the base the emblem of the sacrificed princess as well as her name written in ancient Greek as on antic temples. The front of the base is interchangeable, allowing the Andromeda plate to appear or not on the stone floor. Equipped with an additional platform to elevate him, the Bronze Saint is intended to take place in the diorama composed of Athena and her defending Saints, ready to defend the great Protector of the Sanctuary!</p>

<p>This product is not a toy or product for children. It is a collectors item intended for adults only.</p>39:T898,<p><strong>Saint Seiya</strong> statue of <strong>Aiolia Leo Gold Saint</strong>, size approx.32cm. <strong>Official product</strong> in<strong> limited edition</strong> by <strong>Tsume</strong></p>
<p>Aiolia is the Gold Saint of Leo, and also the brother of the Gold Saint of Sagittarius, Aiolos who was considered a traitor for almost 15 years. Aiolia's loyalty to Sanctuary is unmatched and he's the one sent by The Pope to defeat the rebellious Bronze Saint and Saori Kido. But he's also the first one to join her when she's proved to be the reincarnation of the Goddess Athena, whose Saints are supposed to protect. As fierce as the animal of his constellation, Aiolia is a fearsome warrior and his techniques are deadly and fast as light-speed.<br /><br />For this statue, we sculpted Aiolia as he's throwing his Lightning Bolt (ライトニング・ボルト in Japanese) move which blasts his enemy with a tremendous amount of energy. We made a piece of translucent PVC to mimic the effect on his right hand. To increase realism of the attack, we included a LED lightning system in the arm. The effect is stunning! The posing is very dynamic. The overall is inspired by the duel between Aiolia and Seiya in the Leo Temple. That's why this statue features an extra head. You can choose to display Aiolia whether with his standard head or with the one showing he's under the Pope's magical mind control. As for the base, it mimics the Leo Temple with floor elements and Greek columns however it's damaged by the ongoing battle.<br /><br />Leo Aiolia HQS by Tsume is a balanced piece, very dynamic and it's a great addition in your Saint Seiya HQS by Tsume collection!<br /><br />Resin statue of Aiolia - <b>1600 pieces limited</b> and numbered run, the Gold Saint of Leo, from Saint SeiyaKnights of the Zodiac anime show.

Tell me! » <br /><br />-Camus to Hyoga.<br /><br />After <strong>Deathmask</strong>, a new <strong>Athenas</strong> Saint rises to strengthen <strong>Tsume's Saint Seiya</strong>'s collection. Part of the 12 Gold Saints, and master of the absolute zero give your iciest welcome to <strong>Aquarius Camus</strong>!<br /><br />Cold and insensitive at first sight, his blue eyes as deep as the ocean, his icy gaze and his determined expression only confirm this first impression: he perfectly masters the absolute zero emotion. Like a raging sea in the middle of the storm, his long turquoise hair with luminous reflections, as well as his cape, flutter and fly away as the violent winter wind, released during its icy attack, blows. Camus wears his gold cloth, carefully varnished by our painters: this one reveals the upper part of his bare arms, while the center of his helmet is ornamented with a sea-green jewel.<br /><br />We observe here the Gold Saint as hes carrying out his most terrible attack: the Aurora Execution, a phenomenal energy wave able to approach the closest to absolute zero, or -273.15°C. Camus concentrates his cosmos to the maximum, legs apart, his hands and arms forming an amphora. We see the immense spectral figure of Aquarius rising up behind him. Made in translucent resin, this woman with fine features and long hair, wearing a draped dress and bracelets, displays monochrome tones. Overlooking the Aquarius Saint, she particularly highlights the brightness and warmth of his outfits colours. This spiritual appearance in white and light blue, seems to protect and support the ultimate attack of Camus. Kneeling behind him, she carries with both hands a jar with metallic highlights, filled with a golden liquid that she is about to pour. The imposing clear resin ice peaks rising from the frozen ground only confirm that cold reality: no matter can withstand the sinister caress of this icy kiss ...<br /><br />The statue comes with a numbered plate and a certificate of authenticity.        <br /><br />Scale 1/6 <b>Total run of 2500 pieces</b>.          <br /><br />Artistic direction: Cyril Marchiol, Saesa Kiyokawa, Jon Gonzalez Arroyo<br /><br />Concept art: Marijke Wilms<br /><br />Technical engineering: Jose Ku Chio Lu<br /><br />3D sculptors: Carlos Cruz, Olivier Sam, Eliott Lemaire, Patrick Tran, Muhammet Ay<br /><br />Figurine preparators: Aude Pastor, Aurélie Nagot, Tom Fargnier, Guillaume Hemery<br /><br />Painters: Micka Gros, Eric Jolivalt<br /><br />Size: H: 46cm ; W: 43 cm ; D:55 cm<br /><br />Materials: Resin, PVC, Magnets <br /><br />© Masami Kurumada/Shueisha, Toei Animation<br /><br /></p>3b:T4a2,<p><b>One Piece </b>Statue of <b>Marco the Phoenix </b>in <strong>Ikigai collection,</strong> 1/6 scale size approx.37cm. <strong>Official product</strong> in <strong>limited edition of 2000 pieces</strong> by <strong>Tsume Art</strong>.</p>
<p>- PHOENIX -</p>
<p>Marco's power lies in the Tori Tori no Mi devil fruit, Phoenix model, which allows him to transform into this mythical animal. We have depicted him here in the pose he had in Marineford, facing Kizaru.</p>

<p>His power grants him not only the ability to fly but also exceptional powers of regeneration, symbolizing the resurrection and immortality associated with the phoenix. He can envelop his body in regenerative blue flames, making him nigh invincible. Its flames are represented here on the base, with a superb paint effect.</p>
<p>- LOYAL -</p>
<p>Marco embodies unwavering loyalty to his comrades and crew. As commander of the first division of Whitebeard's crew, he has demonstrated his unwavering dedication time and again. Even after Whitebeard's death, he continued to honor his captain's memory and watch over the former members of the crew.</p>

<p>This statue represents him during his epic fight against Big Mom's minions. He uses not only his sword but also his ability which allows him to separate his soul from his body to move quickly and surprise his opponents. This ability is represented here with a phosphorescent effect.</p>
<p>- SOUL KING -</p>
<p>Talented musician, Soul King Brook was a world star during the 2-year timeskip, before joining the crew heading for the New World. He also uses his instrument to create auditory illusions, disorienting his enemies and allowing surprise attacks.</p>

<p>Inspired by the illustrations of <strong>Eiichiro Oda</strong>, <strong>Oden Ikigai</strong> By <strong>Tsume</strong> is pictured here as he prepares to attack Kaido in Wano Country!</p>
<p>As a true follower of two-saber combat, the colossal <strong>Daimyo</strong> has developed his own Nitoryu : the <strong>Oden</strong> Two-Sword Style. He rushes straight at his enemy by crossing his two legendary swords, Ame no Habakiri " the saber that can slice Heaven itself " with Enma " the saber that can cut through the depths of Hell ", draining all his Armament Haki. The leader of the Nine Red Scabbards owns the only weapon capable of injuring Kaido and shows no mercy. Resting on a few rocky clusters and reflecting on the black lacquered base, we find the symbolic bird of the <strong>Kozuki</strong> family, forever engraved in wood and memories.</p>

<p><em>« We're off, Killer. Let's get our guys. We are charting our own course. » - Kid</em></p>
<p>This statue is an interpretation of the episode "Warriors' Dream! Luffy's Conquer of Udon! " from the Wano Country arc. After the prisoners of Udon finally find the courage to revolt against <strong>Kaido</strong> and Orochi's unjust yoke, they deem a pirate like Luffy untrustworthy, while <strong>Eustass Captain Kid</strong> rejects his offer to join the fight against <strong>Kaido</strong>. Killer having freed him from his chains, they will leave Udon together, thanks to his Devil Fruit’s shattering power!</p>
<p>We thus see the powerful and menacing Supernovae of the Worst Generation, with his grimacing blood red lips and his angry dark gaze crossed by his lightning scars going into action! Using the skills of his Jiki Jiki no Mi, he transforms his crippled arm after his confrontation with the Red Head into a real weapon of mass destruction! As the prisoners watch the metal debris levitate around them, the ruthless Captain of the <strong>Kid</strong> Pirates draws them to him to build himself an indestructible, gigantic mechanical arm, made up of cogs, chains, pipes and innumerable and imposing metal parts!</p>
<p>Throwing his glowing-hued fur coat revealing the wounds on his muscular torso, his good fist clenched, he thrust his mighty Punk Gibson mechanical fist against the thick bars of the gate of Udon Prison, causing it to crash violently, as showed by the crashing effects in transparent resin or the dust rising from the ground suddenly. If Kid shares the same dream as <strong>Luffy</strong>, he intends to achieve his goal in his own way: by using his iron fist to smash every obstacle, determined to pulverize the very limits of the impossible!</p>

<p>This statue represents Captain Buggy and his crew during his spectacular confrontation with Luffy in Orange Town on East Blue, making him his first enemy! Throwing a monkey wrench into this peaceful place, this clownish scene highlights the zaniness and weird abilities of the Star Clown and his singular companions! The cheeky Luffy takes him for a Clown mocking his big nose, he will take away the point of laughing! We thus see the troublemaker making use of the strange powers of his devil fruit Bara Bara no Mi, accidentally swallowed when he was a former apprentice of the Roger Pirates alongside Shanks… Laughing heartily, his clownish makeup highlights his treacherous gaze and reveals his sordid intention: it's time for a celebration! Wearing his exuberant stage costume with his long ringmaster blazer and matching artist hat, his red and white striped t-shirt like a circus tent and his hair-dyed baggy pants, the Clown announces a colorful show that will not fail to surprise you!</p>
<p>His Bara Bara Ho Kirihanashi propels his two fists and their 8 knives to slice the enemy, his Bara Bara Festival cuts his body into pieces to better hit his target and his Bara Bara Senbei brings out sharp blades from his shoes to kick butts with great fanfare! And since one bad trick always hides another, he expels an explosive Baggy Ball from his heel piece, convinced that his cannonballs combined with the powers of his Devil Fruit will allow him to conquer Grand Line and afflict some good lessons! Behind his back, Cabaji the Acrobat prepares an icy trick with his Carnival Tricks! With his cold gaze and ruthless smile, the agile staff chief balanced on his unicycle twirls his checkered scarf, inviting Zoro to challenge him... His sharp saber in one hand and his razor-sharp spinning tops in the other, all means are good for proving that he’s the best swordsman and winning, even if it means cheating!</p>
<p>Having become a burden for his Captain after his failure against Luffy, Mohji the Beast Tamer finds himself relegated to the human cannonball position, while the varnished red Buggy Ball relieved of its usefulness remains on the ground. Renowned for his ability to tame the most ferocious beasts, he hasn't managed to budge with the wild little Chouchou! Usually pompous, the first mate is here sweaty and dominated by fear, his white hair in the shape of polar bear ears, making him look more like a bear cub looking for its mother. As he prays for the wick to go out, his gigantic pet lion Richie gets its behind kicked by its Captain for losing against the tiny but indomitable Chouchou and its new ally!</p>
<p>With its dazed blood red eyes, matted purple mane and many broken fangs, the beast looks almost as fierce as its crying tamer. Finally, we find on the base all the elements of this lively encounter: the dusty debris and roof tiles of the houses razed by the Buggy Ball propelled by the Captain's cannon for fun, the red and black varnished top of his marquee, or even his opened treasure chest and all of his precious berries, jewels and gold bullions scattered after the intrepid Nami tried to steal it, just like the map of Grand Line! As the ultimate treasure, a berry with the crew's logo sits in the middle of the varnished red border. Despite these obstacles, the future Warlord of the sea has more than one trick up his sleeve! The curtain is still open, the show must go on and the joker Clown intends to have the last laugh! GYAHAHAHAHA!!!</p>

<p><em>« I see. You are ready to die to bring me down.» - Doflamingo</em></p>
<p><em>« I would like to see the happy mess that your death will cause, of course. But only one thing matters, the revenge I've been waiting for 13 years. » - Law</em></p>
<p>This statue transcribes the long-awaited confrontation between <strong>Trafalgar D. Water Law</strong> and <strong>Don Quixote Doflamingo</strong> in the episode « Rebecca's Special Attack! Back-to-the-Water Dance! » from the Dressrosa arc. Having stolen Caesar, the Joker's trump card, Law now intends to destroy his precious Smile Factory! Having teamed up with the Straw Hat Pirates to bring down the King of Dressrosa and weaken the Emperor, he will get his 13-year-old revenge whatever it takes! </p>
<p>Fixing the man to be killed with a dark look, his open jacket reveals his tattoo dedicated to Corazon, name also found on his back, while the letters D-E-A-T-H tattooed on his fingers are an explicit message for the king... We thus see the Doctor swooping on the Warlord of the Sea clutching his Nodachi "Kikoku", capable of cutting in distance targets as imposing as sea monsters, with surgical precision... Combining it with the ultimate power of his Devil Fruit Ope Ope no Mi, the Surgeon of Death creates in his hand a ball of energy, while at his feet extends a sphere of aura in transparent blue resin able to divide the body of the patients contained in the operation zone to make of it what he wants! </p>
<p>Under the shock of this overpowering fight and the Supernova’s wrath, the bridge also collapses into a thousand pieces on the base. On the ground, in the midst of the chaos, we notice the spring of a dezinced puppet from the Toys House as well as the wooden head of the decapitated king, the Captain of the Heart Pirates reserving the same fate for the heartless sovereign of the Country of Love, Passion and Toys. The "Keep Out" sign has just collapsed: nothing in this world will be able to prevent<strong> Trafalgar Law</strong> from taking revenge!</p>

<p>This statue is an interpretation of the episode « <strong>A Lightning Counterattack! Nami and Zeus the Thundercloud</strong> » from the Whole <strong>Cake Island arc</strong>, during which Nami uses a lightning attack to help her friends escape<strong> Big Mom</strong> in the Seducing Woods! As <strong>Luffy’s</strong> group treads the meringue soil of Whole Cake Island, surprises are in full swing! Seeing Sanji then losing sight of him, they sink dangerously into the mysterious Seducing Woods delightfully playing with their minds... Very dense, its flora is made up of Homies: living trees, candies and sweets in Big Mom’s service… Deprived of King Baum, getting out of this cursed place where <strong>Nami’s</strong> log pose is out of order seems complicated but not impossible! Intelligent and lucid, the Straw Hat Pirates’ navigator quickly understands that it’s a trap!</p>
<p>Followed by <strong>Zeus</strong>, the Thundercloud with its cap, she intends to satisfy the overwhelming appetite of <strong>Big Mom’s</strong> homie to free her way! Attracting it with her delicious black balls which it loves, the mischievous cat burglar prepares a thunder plan, there is a storm brewing! In her red dress, with her red hair tied back, her glaring eyes and determined expression, Nami wields her Usopp-made Sorcery Climate-Tact high. We notice the blue tangerine and reel tattoo in homage to Bell-mère, Genzo and Nokijo on her arm, her gold bracelet offered by the latter and log pose on her left wrise. To protect her family, she must use a lightning attack: Zeus Breeze Tempo! After Zeus eats one of her Weather Eggs and triples in size, <strong>Nami</strong> summons a gust of wind from her Clima-Tact and sends it flying at the menacing thundercloud with heart-shaped eyes, pink cheeks and tongue hanging out in delight! It then releases several lightning bolts and a terrible yellow transparent resin thunderbolt inflicting considerable damage on Big Mom and her homies!</p>
<p>The grimacing tree serving as a thunderbolt, its leaves are blown away by violent gusts of transparent resin while the Emperor’ Knight, Rook and Bishop soldiers are pulverized in the air! The illuminated lightning strike point shows the tasty panicked woods homies being engulfed by a Tsunami of glazed dark chocolate coulis! Strawberries, smarties, donut with sky blue glaze and hazelnut slivers, pistachio ice cream cone, blueberry muffin with icing on the cake, raspberry lollipop, strawberry coulis shortbread cake, cream and caramel cake, pecan nut cookie or scoop of raspberry ice cream: all are swept away in this yummy avalanche of indulgence! Big Mom wanted to taste a wedding cake, here she is satisfied! The mandarin border of the base reminiscent of Nami’s hair accompanies the emblem of the Straw Hat Pirates, always ready to delight us!</p>

The Devil Child appears here as seen on the Fish-Man Island, with her long brown hair pulled back, her blue jacket ajar and her pink and green sarong with floral patterns. Resting near the multicolored corals reminiscent of the Fish-Man Island, we distinguish a poneglyph, a mysterious stone cut by the Kozuki clan on which would be inscribed the location of the Ancient Weapons and Laugh Tale in an esoteric language that only the paleographer would be able to read!</p>
<p>Both a bright scholar and fighter, the Straw Hat Pirates’ Archaeologist eliminates any obstacle on the road of knowledge! Having eaten the Hana Hana no Mi Fruit, she goes on the attack here, with a determinated gaze and hands crossed to materialize multiple arms around her thanks to the few flower petals twirling, judiciously combining intelligence and boldness, firmness and finesse! </p>

<p><em>- What? What happened?! I… I… I wanna become a louse… » -The Marines</em></p>
<p>This <strong>Ikigai</strong> statue shows <strong>Perona</strong> rescuing the <strong>Straw Hat Pirates</strong> on the Sabaody Archipelago. As <strong>Luffy</strong>, <strong>Zoro</strong>, and <strong>Sanji</strong> make their way to the Thousand Sunny, the Ghost Princess helps them by fending off the Marines with her “Negatives Hollows”. Her ghostly look coincides with the aspect of her phosphorescent grimacing ghosts, dressed in her black and white dress and top hat, enhanced by her pink varnish, boots, watch, long twisted hair and bat tattoo. Her candid side hides a much more sordid reality, holding her stuffed toy resembling Kumashi in one arm, her huge round black eyes gaze with delight at the Navy’ men on whom she projects with her free arm her hungry ghosts in transparent resin! These specters are now swooping down on their prey to wrest any desire to live from them, the best way to enchant the dreaded former commander of the Wild Zombies! </p>

<p>I could do the worst atrocities in the world, I'll always be forgiven Do you know why? Because I AM the most beautiful woman theyve ever seen!Boa Hancock, Amazon Lily Empress, captain of the Kuja pirates crew.<br /><br />With the "Snake Princess " Boa Hancock, second of the Seven Warlords, after Trafalgar D. Law, in our One Piece HQS + by Tsume collection, Tsume offers One Majestic Piece.<br /><br />This HQS + statue by Tsume reflects the destructive power that Boa Hancock exerts on men, who, stunned by such beauty, literally fell down at her feet, being instantly turned to stone ... Beautiful to die for, her piercing eyes of a blue as dark and icy as the abyssal depths, does not show any emotion. Meanwhile, her snake Salome reveals a sharp smile by encircling the victims bewitched by the captivating beauty of the inaccessible Boa Hancock. Unable to resist the temptation, her prey are trapped, petrified by the absolute power of her devils fruit!<br /><br />We depicted her in the same way as she appears in the Marine Ford's Arc, accompanied by her faithful snake Salome. Standing on one leg, with her flowing hair and resolute gaze, Boa emanates as much charm as power, honoring her Empress status. The composition of the statue, from the character balance to the snake entanglement, adds movement to this special piece. A feeling enhanced by the draped tissue of Boa's dress as well as her voluminous hair thrown back with a dismissive gesture of her left hand. At her feet are two pirates turned into stone, a Slave Arrow right into their heart. On the base, the frozen waves are a reference to Admiral Aokijis intervention at the start of the Marine Ford war. Finally, you will find the symbol of the Kuja pirates as well as a purple strip to recall Boa's outfit.<br /><br />On both artistic or technical sides, Tsume offers a majestic piece worthy of such an empress ... and her most uncompromising fans!<br /><br />The statue comes with a numbered plate and a certificate of authenticity.<br /><br /><b>Total run of 2.500 pieces.</b><br /><br />Characteristics:<br /><br />Artistic direction: Saesa Kiyokawa, Cyril Marchiol<br /><br />Concept art: Giorgia Lenzi<br /><br />3D sculptors: Muhammet Ay, Olivier Sam, Patrick Tran<br /><br />Technical engineering: Muhammet Ay, Jose Ku Chio Lu<br /><br />Statue preparation: Tom Fargnier, Mickael Gros<br /><br />Painting: Mickael Gros, Éric Jolivalt, Aurélie Nagot, Laurent Roussel<br /><br />Scale: 1/4<br /><br />Size: L: 44 cm / P: 40 cm / H: 51 cm<br /><br />Materials: Polyresin, PU, PVC, ABS, magnets</p>

Sitting in the middle of this luxuriant vegetation, Law waits, a sly smile on the lips. The 1/4 scale allowed us to accentuate the details, be it the texture of the hat, the transparent leaves or the fineness of his tattoos.<br /><br />The final touch to this composition is the sphere available as an option to visualize the space created by its fruit of the demon.<br /><br />The statue comes with a numbered plate and a certificate of authenticity.<br /><br />Scale 1/4 <b>Total run of 1800 pieces</b>.<br /><br />Size: H: 46,8 cm/ D: 42,9 cm / W: 47,6 cm<br /><br />©  Eiichiro  Oda/Shueisha,  Toei  Animation</p>4a:T510,<p><b>My Hero Academia </b>statue of <b>Stain </b>in <strong>Ikigai collection,</strong> 1/6 scale size approx.43cm. <strong>Official product</strong> in <strong>limited edition of 400 pieces</strong> by <strong>Tsume Art</strong>.</p>

<p><em>« The Great lord Elder prophesied that I would be the one to guide the revolution. A person who would make a great choice that will bring either peace or destruction to the world of the shinobi. »</em><br /><br />An epic moment that we decided to immortalize through the realization of a 1/8 HQS statue by <strong>Tsume</strong>, paying tribute to the heroic legendary ninja! Very dynamic, the statue emphasises the intense emotion felt in the heart of the action, like a freeze frame: that of one ultimate heartbeat, a last will that will change the course of the future ...<br /><br />The scene takes place in Nagatos original village : Ame, the Village Hidden in the Rain. Indeed, behind the rock plate where Jiraiya is agonizing, we find imposing line pipe and grids, covered with a metallic paint mixing copper, brown, black and gray shades for a realistic rendering. Under the effect of the 5 ninjas powerful attack, the water in bluish transparent resin is unleashing, creating scum. The legendary ninja begins what he thinks to be his ultimate fight: the time of his great choice has come! Determined to unmask Pain, he recognizes Yahiko, one of his former students having lost his live. As Tendô, he wears Pains violet ring on his thumb and takes the role of leader, being above the 4 other ninjas.<br /><br />These former shinobis were all once defeated by <strong>Jiraiya</strong>. They wear the long black robe with the Akatsuki symbol, painted with black, gray and dark red shades, then covered with a matte varnish to be faithful to the license. Their hair is painted in a gradient of light and darker orange while their barred headband indicates that they have deserted the Village Hidden in the Rain. Their pupils are formed of gray and purple concentric circles ... The dōjutsu Rinnegan ... Nagato! The dozens of metal piercings implanted in the corpses of the ninjas, serve as emitters and receivers of chakra, allowing Nagato to remotely control them ... While Jiraiya finally gets his answer, 5 spears pierce his back, staining his long white hair with blood. Lying in a pool of his own blood, in reddish and varnished transparent resin, the condemned ninja remembers Narutos unwavering determination ... A memory allowing his heart to beat one last time to finally carry out his mission. Grimacing with his bloody mouth, showing a glassy but determined look, he uses the chakra in bluish transparent resin emanating from his fingertip, to engrave a coded message on Fukasakus back. Here, we notice his arm pierced by the spear of the 6th Pain he killed. The toad, just like Jiraiya, shows an expression of both pain and obstinacy: it became the key to stop Pain, ready to deliver this crucial message ... While Jiraiya is slowly dying, the 5 Pain pounce on him to put a definitive end to his life, their robe thrown back due to the speed of movement.<br /><br />His duty accomplished, the legendary ninja lets himself be serenely dragged to the abyssal depths. Jiraiyas last thoughts are about his next novel, which he decides to call "The Story of Naruto Uzumaki", because he is absolutely sure now : here is the Child of the Prophecy!<br /><br />The statue comes with a numbered plate and a certificate of authenticity.<br /><br /><b>Total run of 2,750 pieces</b>.<br /><br />Dimensions: L: 59.5 cm; W: 55.7 cm; D: 49.6 cm<br /><br /><iframe width="560" height="315" style="background-image:url(&quot;img/object.gif&quot;);" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rXUaKJXNnpw" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>4d:T932,<p><b>Naruto </b>Statue of<b> Orochimaru </b>in <b>BIJUtsu collection,</b> 1/4 scale size approx.53cm. <strong>Official product</strong> in <strong>limited edition of 800 pieces</strong> by <strong>Tsume Art</strong>.</p>

<p>This bust offers not one but three versions of Naruto: from the child, wanting to prove his worth, to the Hokage having achieved his goal, via the teenager, hero of the village of Konoha... We are proud to present the Legend of Naruto Uzumaki.</p>
<p>As a tribute to the Naruto licence in its entirety, the bust is packed with detail. You'll find the leaf with the hole in it, symbolising the name of the village. There are also references to Kyubi from the different versions of Naruto. Particular attention has also been paid to the scenery, whether it's the village or the Hokage mountain. Finally, the symbol on the base varies according to the side of the statue: the Uzumaki family symbol in the child and teenage versions of Naruto, and the Hokage symbol in the adult version.</p>
<p>Naruto's values, characteristic of the Shonen spirit we hold so dear, were one of the driving forces behind Tsume's creation 13 years ago. It all started with Gaara HQS, the foundation stone of a story that seemed unimaginable...</p>
<p>So we couldn't do things by halves for the MUB dedicated to Naruto Uzumaki. It had to be exceptional in order to pay tribute to this iconic character with whom so many people at Tsume can identify.</p>

<p><em>"-It’s a special single war attack (…) - Guy</em></p>
<p><em>-Super Shark Bomb Jutsu! - Kisame</em></p>
<p><em>-Hirudora!"</em></p>
<p>This 1/8 statue, intended to take place in front of <strong>Gaï Maïto</strong> - <strong>HQS</strong>, is an interpretation of the ultimate fight between the Master of Taijutsu, Might Guy, and the Suiton Expert, <strong>Kisame Hoshigaki</strong>, in the episode “Battle in Paradise! The Odd Beast vs. The Monster!“ from <strong>Naruto Shippuden</strong>. After the Monster of the Hidden Mist, infiltrating the island to locate Naruto and Killer B, emerges from the Waterfall of Truth with valuable information about the ninja alliance, he absorbs Killer B and Aoba's Chakra and escapes, pursued by the Sublime Green Beast of Prey of Konoha! This is the third time their forces clash, it will be the last! Determined to deliver his report at all costs, the Fish-Man hides it in the mouse of a shark and creates a thousand more to breach Guy's Chakra wall, two sharks attacking here at his side, ready to tear him apart.</p>
<p>Unable to destroy all of these predators, the Power of Youth’s Defender opens the Seventh Gate of Wonder and unleashes his secret weapon and most powerful attack: the Daytime Tiger! Endowed with superhuman strength according to Might Guy, the Cannibal retaliates with a special technique devouring the Chakra of his opponent. We thus see the Akatsuki Shark similar to the ocean’s most frightening predator, with his gills, shark skin, hair in fins, rows of sharp teeth and petrifying gaze of a cold-blooded killer, creating a gigantic Super Shark Bomb Jutsu in bluish transparent resin echoing the depths of the ocean! With outstretched hands, the ruthless <strong>Kisame</strong> hurls his hungry prehistoric monster with innumerable sharp teeth at his prey to make short work of it, this Suiton technique being a more powerful version of the Water Shark Bomb Jutsu. As he explains to his enemy “The Super Shark Bomb Jutsu attack is not a trivial technique. It absorbs all the Chakra it encounters and gains intensity, depending on the power of its opponent's ninjutsu.“ and he will demonstrate it to him.</p>
<p>As if to attract the feline's attention, a light springs from the shark bowels rising from the abyss of the ocean, crossing the watery Megalodon with its luminous reflection. The shock of the confrontation between the ferocious feline and the bloodthirsty shark unleashes the forces of the ocean, creating a setting of water and foam in transparent resin with different bluish hues around the Shark-Man and his ilk! Mastering all the power of his element, <strong>Itachi Uchiha'</strong>s former partner will stop at nothing to succeed in his mission, whatever its end. On a watery blue edging, Kisame's name appears alongside the crossed-out acronym of the Kiri village which he has deserted. This final message to send reminds us that this solitary predator chooses his own trajectory, and having little fear of troubled waters, will decide for himself the end of his story!</p>

<p>This statue depicts <strong>Rock Lee</strong> revealing his true power and impressive shinobi abilities, resulting from an unerring determination and extreme training! Inspired by the episodes "<strong>Gaara vs Rock Lee</strong>, The Power of Youth Explodes" and "The Fifth Gate: A Splendid Ninja is Born" from Naruto, Might Guy’s favorite student shows here his perfect mastery of taijutsu in his fight against <strong>Gaara</strong>! Allowed by his sensei to remove his weights, he frees himself dropping them loudly to the ground in a cloud of whitish resin dust, as observed on the base.</p>
<p>The taijutsu expert, looking like his master in his green jumpsuit with Konoha headband belted at the waist and orange gaiters, can now use his incredible speed and great power! Concentrating all of his strength, with his pupils turning white and his darker complexion, his visible veins and black hair thrown into the air, Rock Lee is seen here opening the fourth Gate of Pain and then the fifth Gate of Limit to totally unleash his flow of chakra and go beyond his limits! As seen with the blue chakra flames emanating from his body and the moving headbands around his arms, he sets out to use his unstoppable speed and ultimate technique to shatter the sand armor of his indestructible adversary: the Reverse Lotus Flower! Throwing his opponent into the air, the «nice guy» embodying the Power of Youth reminds everyone that he will not back down from anything, ready to win any fight as a real shinobi! </p>

<p><em> «Senbon Rainstorm, huh? Well, I’ll make it rain blood.»- Gaara</em></p>
<p>This statue is an interpretation of the episode «Akamaru trembles: <strong>Gaara’s</strong> cruel strength!» from <strong>Naruto</strong>, in which the shinobi from Sunagakure reveals his terrible power. Accompanied by his brother and sister, he crosses paths with three Genin from Amegakure, determined to face them. Countering the Senbon Rainstorm triggered by his opponent thanks to his impenetrable Shield of Sand, he offers him to discover in turn his blood rainstorm... We thus see Gaara of the Desert, with his clear but dark gaze, using his deadly ninjutsu technique Sand Binding Coffin against his three adversaries. The Kanji "love" on his forehead symbolizes the demon loving only himself while his blood red hair clearly shows his colors... His leather strap keeps Suna’s headband at his waist and the huge jar behind his back. Open, the sand is released and spreads on the rocks to form hands catching and imprisoning the enemy with his Sand Binding Prison.</p>
<p>The ruthless shinobi then exerts pressure instantly crushing his victim, sparing him a painful agony, according to him... Once reduced to ashes, he watches with amusement as the condemned man spreads in a disturbing rain of blood and sand… Horrified by this bloody spectacle, he will not let the Genin witnesses flee, reserving the same macabre fate for them. Reaching the tower in an hour and a half, Gaara and his team break the record without the slightest injury or a single grain of sand or bloodstain on their clothes... </p>

<p><em>“-It’s a special single war attack (…)</em></p>
<p><em>-Super Shark Bomb Jutsu!</em></p>
<p><em>-Hirudora! “ - Might Guy to Kisame.</em></p>
<p>This HQS statue of Might Guy shows him going on the attack during his final fight against <strong>Kisame Hoshigaki</strong>, in the episode « Battle in Paradise! The Odd Beast vs. The Monster! ».</p>
<p>As the Konoha’s jōnin rank ninja arrives at the Water Fall of Truth to aid <strong>Naruto</strong> in his training, he comes face to face with the Monster of the Hidden Mist that infiltrated the island to locate Naruto and Killer B! This is the third time their forces clash, it must be the last! He certainly won’t let <strong>Itachi Uchiha</strong>’s former partner run away with the information gathered about the ninja alliance! As the shark-like Swordsman of the Mist attacks him with his terrifying Super Shark Bomb Jutsu absorbing ninjutsu attacks, the Taijutsu master brings out his secret weapon! With his red Konoha forehead band belted at the waist, orange leggings, black hair and green protective vest thrown into the air, the Power of Youth’s defender is seen in an attack position, retaliating with his most powerful technique: the Daytime Tiger! This technique of taijutsu, Hirudora, requires the opening of seven of the Eight Gates. Thus, after opening the seventh Gate, that of Wonder, the team leader places the palm of his extended hand in front of him and hits it with his other closed hand, suddenly increasing the pressure of the air in front of him. We then see the Konoha’s Sublime Green Beast of Prey, his red eyes glowing with rage with his bright green chakra flames, forming the incantatory sign specific to his technique: the index and middle fingers crossed and the other fingers outstretched. The resulting mass of compressed air is then projected in the direction of Kisame taking on the appearance of a huge ghostly rabid tiger, sculpted here in white transparent resin with varying degrees of opacity. Roaring, it swoops down on its prey wildly, its gigantic illuminated jaws ready to make short work of Kisame. On contact with the target, the suddenly decompressed air causes a gigantic explosion, causing visible shock waves agitating the raging waters in bluish transparent resin, highlighting the power of the unstoppable attack and location of this epic last stand! The symbol of the victorious ninja of Konoha proudly appears on the front of the statue’s base... Who’s next?!</p>

<div></div>
<div><em>"I want to protect the person important to me I want to work for that person. I want to fight for that person. I want to make that person's dream come true That is my dream."- Haku</em><br /><br />This HQS statue of <strong>Zabuza</strong> and <strong>Haku</strong> pays a poignant tribute to the powerful bond that unites them. By reaching out to him and making him his unstoppable weapon, Zabuza offers the orphan the opportunity to be useful to someone, becoming from that day his only reason for living. While the two inseparable ninjas advance side by side, they also benefit from the same fighting ability: they master the force of water. Thus, we see in the foreground the Demon of the Hidden Mist, brandishing above his head his gigantic legendary sword Kubikiribôchô, renowned as the Seversword, in order to carry out its task. The rogue ninja wears his black outfit, his striped Kirigakure leg-warmers, his forehead band to the side, and although the lower part of his face is covered with bandages, these cannot mask his ruthless expression. Devoid of any mercy, he uses the Water Dragon Bullet Technique to swallow his prey. Protecting his rear and offering him total obedience, the descendant of the Yuki clan, is more than ready to defend the only person who matters to him, whatever the cost With one hand, we see the shinobi withdraw his hunter-nin mask revealing his real face, on the other hand, prepare his fatal attack! Endowed with a kekkei genkai: Ice Release, like his late mother, the orphan of the Land of Water causes the Demonic Mirroring Ice Crystals to appear. Very quickly, we see him insert his right leg, ready to trap his target and assail him from all sides with countless bloody throws of senbons. In an offensive posture, wearing his green and brown kimono, his obi thrown back, and his headband with Kirigakure symbol on his forehead, his gentle face in no way deceives his emotions, he will immediately bring down anyone who tries to reach <strong>Zabuza</strong>. Indebted to him and not fearing any enemy, nor even death itself, he will protect until the end the one who gave meaning to his life.<br /><br />The statue comes with a numbered plate and a certificate of authenticity.<br /><br />Total run of  2500 pieces.<br /><br />Dimensions: H: 47 cm, W: 33 cm, D: 35 cm</div>

<p>Hashirama Senju is the first Hokage, and, with Madara Uchiha, the co-founder of Konoha, the hidden village of the leaf. Unable to agree on how to carry out their ideals of peace, the two ninjas end up fighting in a historic battle.<br /><br />Our new HQS is inspired by a memorable scene of this fight. It represents Hashirama in Sage mode invoking a Wood Golem with the technique of the Wood Release: Wood Human Technique ( "Mokuton - Mokujin no Jutsu"). Both feet firmly planted on the head of Golem, Hashirama makes the symbol of the snake with his hands. The combined effect of the wind and the release of his chakra raises his hair. His face is marked with the effects of the Sage mode.<br /><br />The work of sculpture and painting highlights the realistic wooden textures and the armor of Hashirama.<br /><br />Finally, a LED lighting system brings life to the eyes of the Golem and the dragon on his shoulder.<br /><br />It is an imposing and finely made statue in line with our last Naruto HQS.<br /><br /><b>Limited edition only 2000 pieces worldwide</b>.

<p><strong>Naruto Shippuden</strong> statue of <strong>Killer Bee &amp; Bijû Hachibi</strong>, size approx.41cm. <strong>Official product</strong> in <strong>limited edition</strong> by <strong>Tsume</strong>.</p>
<p>Jinchuuriki Killer Bee HQS by Tsume is a tribute to the most surprising duo from Naruto Shippuden. Killer Beethe rapperand the Bijû he lives with peacefully, Hachibi. Together, they will set a precious example for Naruto on his way to master the powerful chakra of the Kyubi!<br /><br />With our HQS statue, we set Killer Bee in motion. He's standing on top of Hachibi's springing out of water. The ninja is in fighting stance, one leg and one arm streched forward. This is a character which comes greatly as a sculpture since he offers so many contrasts and details, from the tone of his skin to the elements of his outfit. He also features blades, specific tatoos and a pair of sunshades all of these are as many details the eye catches when you're watching your statue every day. There's also the nice motion given to his scarf to add dynamics and balance to the whole statue.<br /><br />The gigantic bull demon who always goes with Killer Bee is set here springing out of water and roaring, his powerful jaws wide open! His great eight tentacles are surrounding his host, to protect him and strike any threat that might come. Hachibi has been very thoroughly sculpted and he's very much alike the one drawn by Masashi Kishimoto, especially if you check the head or the eyes. The painting job features a lot of gradients to emphasise the overall and a glossy varnish on the tentacle's suckers add a slight contrast on both tone and textures.<br /><br />Hachibi seems to be springing out of the base he's on. Blue waves of water made of translucent resin are splashing around it, creating a striking contrast of matter and color between Hachibi and the base. Speaking of the base, it's mate black as always with our HQS by Tsume statues with our traditional colored stripe whose pattern mimics the clouds of Kumo's hidden village. Then, you'll find the usual metallic plate with the character's name and the symbol of his village.<br /><br />Numbered Edition: 1000 pieces. Killer Bee &amp; Hachibi, from the anime Naruto Shippuden. Including: one Killer Bee statue, its companion the Bijû called Hachibi, and its base.

<p> Inspired by different scenes of the show, this statue features the heir of the Uchiha clan in a counter stance. Standing behind him the massive Susanoo jutsu, ready to fire a chakra arrow charged with Amaterasu.The titan, fully casted in clear resin, displays variations of purple and uses contrast to mimic the chakras visual effect. The flames on its base were the biggest challenge. The second challenge was to keep this piece within reasonable size so it would be easily displayed in showcases.</p>
<p> Sasuke is fully in extension, the sword drawn out and ready to delivera lethal blow to his opponent. Hes coming with two alternate heads : the first one features both eyes with the Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan, and blood trail related to the use of the Amaterasu jutsu.

<p>Here comes the legendary ninja in a kabuki pose, his left arm stretched out in front of him, balanced on his right leg bent on a heap of sand-colored rocks. His posture, like the cheerful expression we can see on his face, fits perfectly with his personality. Its metallic gray headband bears the kanji symbol "Abura", meaning "Oil", while a red line descends from each of his eyes like a teardrop. <br /><br />His long graying white hair attached by an elastic band is in movement, just like his overcoat in dark red hues. Dressed in his mesh outfit, his khaki kimono, his black belt, as well as his geta, he looks nothing like a traditional ninja. He constantly carries with him the parchment allowing him to sign the pawn invocation pact, attached by two ropes to his shoulders.<br /><br />Jiraya is carrying his orange-covered book "Icha Icha Paradise" in his right hand, the first book of his Icha Icha novels series, of which Kakashi remains the biggest fan.<br /><br />Nicknamed the "Pervy Sage" by Naruto, because of his strong fondness for women, the ninja often justifies his vice as an inspiration for writing his stories; a hobby that brings him a lot of money that he always know how to spend...<br /><br />© 2002 MASASHI KISHIMOTO / 2007 SHIPPUDEN.

<p><em>« The Great lord Elder prophesied that I would be the one to guide the revolution. A person who would make a great choice that will bring either peace or destruction to the world of the shinobi. »</em><br /><br />An epic moment that we decided to immortalize through the realization of a 1/8 HQS statue by <strong>Tsume</strong>, paying tribute to the heroic legendary ninja! Very dynamic, the statue emphasises the intense emotion felt in the heart of the action, like a freeze frame: that of one ultimate heartbeat, a last will that will change the course of the future ...<br /><br />The scene takes place in Nagatos original village : Ame, the Village Hidden in the Rain. Indeed, behind the rock plate where Jiraiya is agonizing, we find imposing line pipe and grids, covered with a metallic paint mixing copper, brown, black and gray shades for a realistic rendering. Under the effect of the 5 ninjas powerful attack, the water in bluish transparent resin is unleashing, creating scum. The legendary ninja begins what he thinks to be his ultimate fight: the time of his great choice has come! Determined to unmask Pain, he recognizes Yahiko, one of his former students having lost his live. As Tendô, he wears Pains violet ring on his thumb and takes the role of leader, being above the 4 other ninjas.<br /><br />These former shinobis were all once defeated by <strong>Jiraiya</strong>. They wear the long black robe with the Akatsuki symbol, painted with black, gray and dark red shades, then covered with a matte varnish to be faithful to the license. Their hair is painted in a gradient of light and darker orange while their barred headband indicates that they have deserted the Village Hidden in the Rain. Their pupils are formed of gray and purple concentric circles ... The dōjutsu Rinnegan ... Nagato! The dozens of metal piercings implanted in the corpses of the ninjas, serve as emitters and receivers of chakra, allowing Nagato to remotely control them ... While Jiraiya finally gets his answer, 5 spears pierce his back, staining his long white hair with blood. Lying in a pool of his own blood, in reddish and varnished transparent resin, the condemned ninja remembers Narutos unwavering determination ... A memory allowing his heart to beat one last time to finally carry out his mission. Grimacing with his bloody mouth, showing a glassy but determined look, he uses the chakra in bluish transparent resin emanating from his fingertip, to engrave a coded message on Fukasakus back. Here, we notice his arm pierced by the spear of the 6th Pain he killed. The toad, just like Jiraiya, shows an expression of both pain and obstinacy: it became the key to stop Pain, ready to deliver this crucial message ... While Jiraiya is slowly dying, the 5 Pain pounce on him to put a definitive end to his life, their robe thrown back due to the speed of movement.<br /><br />His duty accomplished, the legendary ninja lets himself be serenely dragged to the abyssal depths. Jiraiyas last thoughts are about his next novel, which he decides to call "The Story of Naruto Uzumaki", because he is absolutely sure now : here is the Child of the Prophecy!<br /><br />The statue comes with a numbered plate and a certificate of authenticity.<br /><br /><b>Total run of 2,750 pieces</b>.<br /><br />Dimensions: L: 59.5 cm; W: 55.7 cm; D: 49.6 cm<br /><br /><iframe width="560" height="315" style="background-image:url(&quot;img/object.gif&quot;);" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rXUaKJXNnpw" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>60:Te63,<p><strong>Naruto</strong> Statue of <strong>Naruto &amp; Kyubi ( Kurama )</strong> in <strong>HQS </strong>range, 1/8 scale size approx.34cm. <strong>Official product</strong> in <strong>limited edition</strong> by <strong>Tsume Ar</strong>t.</p>
<p>Its time watch again or for the first time the story of the young boy who dreamt of becoming <strong>Hokage</strong>! To celebrate this release, TSUME and KANA HOME VIDEO are proud to present a collector edition including an exclusive complete Blu-ray box and a <strong>Naruto &amp; Kyubi</strong> - Linked by the seal HQS by Tsumes statue.<br /><br /><strong>Naruto</strong> was only a baby when he became a vessel where Kyubi, the terrible Nine-tailed Demon Fox, in order to imprison him. While often feeling cursed with it, <strong>Naruto</strong> learnt to live with it and even eventually befriended his guest. This is the feeling we wanted to emphasize here: the unusual bond between a young boy and his Tailed Beast.<br /><br />Based on one of our artists original artwork, this statue features <strong>Uzumaki</strong> <strong>Naruto</strong>, sitting on a massive <strong>Kyubi</strong>. We can feel the fresh feeling of understanding and friendship between those two. <strong>Naruto</strong> is watching Kyubi, looking annoyed by his guests giant tails. Kyubis looking at Naruto, feeling slightly upset, yet kind of amused.<br /><br />The sculpture fuses digital art and traditional art to achieve a stunning visual result, both precise and organic. While being technical and complex, the statue still displays reasonable sizes so as many collectors as possible may be able to exhibit her with no need of a specific setup. One of the most important part of the art was to get Naruto and Kyubis expressions right,  just as their gazes. This is our first piece in the original Naruto universe, and we wanted to offer an original composition where sculpting and painting would convey as accurate as it can the shows ambiance.<br /><br />The statue comes with a numbered plate and a certificate of authenticity.<br /><br /><strong>Limited to 1600 pieces.</strong><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>The pack contains :</strong></span></p>
