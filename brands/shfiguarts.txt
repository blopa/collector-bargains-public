1d:T63c,"Sparkingummy! Yummy!"
From the series "Kamen Rider Gavv", Dark Shoma's transformation, Kamen Rider Gavv Sparkingummy Form, now available from S.H.Figuarts!

										The shaping of the body matches, with sharp edges all over. Rider's distinctive body shape and surface patterns are faithfully reproduced as well.
Color gradation on key areas clear parts on the head further add to how accurately it resembles what is seen on the show. The dark coloring that covers the entire body is also expressed in a finishing that aligns with the look of the actual character.
The Bitter Gavv, a mouth on his stomach, features a gimmick that makes its upper jaw open and close, as well as a rotating handle. The Sparkingummy Gochizo set inside can be attached to and removed from the beltas well. The Vrocan Spicy Gochizo on his left hip can be detached from the holder and held in his hands using the included hand parts.
Also included is the Bitter Gavvgablade, the special weapon that Kamen Rider Gavv created himself. The shape of the blade, with all its aggressive intensity, is painstakingly reproduced.
The figure's joint structure preserves the natural lines of the human body, allowing you to position the figure natural-looking poses. This also allows you to make the figure perform the impressive and ferocious actions you see in the show. You can even pull out the shoulder joints to create poses where he holds the Bitter Gavvgablade with both hands.

The rear back unit has been changed to a vivid metallic green color to match with the "S.H.Figuarts (SHINKOCCHOU SEIHOU) KAMEN RIDER W CYCLONE JOKER (FUUTO PI ANIMATED ANNIVERSARY)" (sold separately).
The rear back unit features metallic green coloring with different brightness levels for the top and bottom parts. Additionally, the exhaust pipe and license plate areas have been given a darker green color than the rest of the body. The license plate also recreates the "Fuuto Number" that you can see in the anime.

Newly sculpted smoke effect parts are included as well. The smoke that arises from the friction between the tires and the ground has been recreated in dynamic shaping, inspired by the anime. This lets you enjoy displays that capture the excitement of racing through Shadow Fuuto.

Two different color tones of gold are used for the body, to emphasize the differences of color on each area. PVC sheet is used for the cape on his back to ensure the appearance stays true to the drama. 
Various parts of the figure are shaped to maintain the carefully sculpted look of the character, from the intricately shaped head, which resembles a crown, to the whip accents on various parts of the body. The compound eyes are made with clear parts for an appearance very same as what is seen in the drama. 
Also included is his special weapon he uses during Caking Form, the Gavvwhipir. The whip portion is reproduced using soft material for a look similar to that in the show. Two versions of the Caking Gochizo used to transform into Caking Form are included as well: one open, loaded on Gavv's stomach, and one closed, which can be set on the Gavvwhipir. 
The figure's joint structure preserves the natural lines of the human body, allowing you to create a wide range of natural-looking poses as you wish, including actions when he is wielding the mighty Gavvwhipir.20:T41d,From the theatrical film "Ultraman Arc the Movie: The Clash of Light and Evil", the Dark Warrior Guil Arc is now avaliable!

The striking black and dark silver color scheme of the body is reproduced with meticulous paintwork. Included is an effect part to recreate Guil Arc’s signature finishing move, "Guil Arc Finalize".
As a bonus, the figure also comes with a full set of parts that allows you to equip the separately sold S.H.Figuarts Galaxy Armor!
What's more, the "Arc Finalize Effect Part" and "Beam Clash Effect Parts", which can be used with the separately sold S.H.Figuarts Ultraman Arc, are included, allowing you to recreate iconic scenes from the movie!21:T7cd,"Well... Let's do this."
The third Kamen Rider, Kamen Rider Vram Pudding Custom from "Kamen Rider Gavv" is now available from S.H.Figuarts series!

										His distinctive pudding motif is faithfully recreated in the design of this figure. The bright yellow and orange coloring is reproduced with incredible accuracy. The body is finished in matte black and gunmetal coloring, with different textures for each part of the body. The compound eyes on the head are made with clear parts for an appearance very similar to what is seen in the series.
The Vrastom Gear on the belt is also made with clear parts, and even the pudding mold that peeks out from the outside into the interior is carefully color-coded. The lever on the Vrastom Gear moves up and down as well. Exchangeable hands made for operating the lever are included, allowing you to recreate special move activation scenes.
The figure's joint structure preserves the natural lines of the human body, allowing you to position the figure in natural-looking poses. This makes it possible to recreate the eye-catching, dynamic actions that you see on the show to your liking.

Also the weapon "Vram Breaker"is included. The coloring and design of each part is reproduced with the same color-coding used on the main body, and the blade at the tip can switch between two modes: bow mode and scythe mode.
The "Vram Breaker" also comes with exchangeable parts that make it possible to pull the rear lever. The carefully crafted design also recreates the changing colors in the window.
Furthermore, by removing the Doppudding Gochizo from the belt and setting it in the "Vram Breaker", you can recreate the scenes where special moves are activated in "bow mode".
Following the release of the Gavv and Valen figures, Vram now joins them as the third main Kamen Riders in the S.H. Figuarts Kamen Rider Gavv series! From intense battles between the Riders to the three of them standing side by side, the possibilities of fun have greatly expanded!5:["$","$L1c",null,{"brand":{"id":"c338e77f-7a62-4f9c-a6c8-9c5118fb4d26","name":"S.H.Figuarts","slug":"shfiguarts","description":"S.H.Figuarts","createdAt":"$D2025-04-03T23:40:36.653Z","updatedAt":"$D2025-04-15T15:38:41.230Z","deletedAt":null,"products":[{"id":"efc002fe-a3a2-4bd5-b37a-83e2c19b5ebd","name":"S.H.Figuarts
